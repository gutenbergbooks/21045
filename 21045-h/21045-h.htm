    <span style="margin-left: 28em;"><span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</span> <br />

    <p>To few men does life bring a brighter day than that which places the crown upon
    their scholastic labors, and bids them go forth from the halls of the Alma Mater to
    the great world's battlefield. There is a freshness in these early triumphs which,
    like the bloom and fragrance of the flower, is quickly lost, never to be found again
    even by those for whom Fortune reserves her most choice gifts. Fame, though hymned by
    myriad tongues, is not so sweet as the delight we drink from the tear-dimmed eyes of
    our mothers and sisters, in the sacred hours when we can yet claim as our own
    the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> love of
    higher things, the faith and hope which make this mortal life immortal, and fill a
    moment with a wealth of memories which lasts through years. The highest joy is
    serious, and in the midst of supreme delight there comes to the soul a stillness
    which permits it to rise to the serene sphere where truth is most gladly heard and
    most easily perceived; and in such exaltation, the young see that life is not what
    they take it to be. They think it long; it is short. They think it happy; it is full
    of cares and sorrows. This two-fold illusion widens the horizon of life and tinges it
    with gold. It gives to youth its charm and makes of it a blessed time to which we
    ever turn regretful eyes. But I am wrong to call illusion that which in truth is but
    an omen of the divine possibilities of man's nature. To the young, life is not mean
    or short, because the blessed freedom of youth may make it noble and immortal. The
    young stand upon the threshold of the world. Of the many careers which are open to
    human activity, they will choose one; and their fortunes will be various, even though
    their merits should be equal. But if position, fame, and wealth are often denied to
    the most persistent efforts and the best ability, it is consoling to know they are
    not the highest; and as they are not the end of life, they should not be made its
    aim. An<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> aim,
    nevertheless, we must have, if we hope to live to good purpose. All men, in fact,
    whether or not they know it, have an ideal, base or lofty, which molds character and
    shapes destiny. Whether it be pleasure or gain or renown or knowledge, or several of
    these, or something else, we all associate life with some end, or ends, the
    attainment of which seems to us most desirable.</p>
    <p>This ideal, that which in our inmost souls we love and desire, which we lay to
    heart and live by, is at once the truest expression of our nature and the most potent
    agency in developing its powers. Now, in youth we form the ideals which we labor to
    body forth in our lives. What in these growing days we yearn for with all our being,
    is heaped upon us in old age. All important, therefore, is the choice of an ideal;
    for this more than rules or precepts will determine what we are to become. The love
    of the best is twin-born with the soul. What is the best? What is the worthiest
    life-aim? It must be something which is within the reach of every one, as Nature's
    best gifts&mdash;air and sunshine and water&mdash;belong to all. What only the few
    can attain, cannot be life's real end or the highest good. The best is not far
    removed from any one of us, but is alike near to the poor and the rich, to the
    learned and the ignorant, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10"
    id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> shepherd and the king, and only the best can give to
    the soul repose and contentment. What then is the true life-ideal? Recalling to mind
    the thoughts and theories of many men, I can find nothing better than this, "Seek ye
    first the kingdom of God." "Love not pleasure," says Carlyle, "love God. This is the
    everlasting Yea, wherein all contradiction is solved; wherein whoso walks and works,
    it is well with him."</p>
    <p>To the high and aspiring heart of youth, fame, honor, glory, appeal with such
    irresistible power, and appear clad in forms so beautiful, that at a time of life
    when all of us are unreal in our sentiments and crude in our opinions, they are often
    mistaken for the best. But fame is good only in so far as it gives power for good.
    For the rest, it is nominal. They who have deserved it care not for it. A great soul
    is above all praise and dispraise of men, which are ever given ignorantly and without
    fine discernment. The popular breath, even when winnowed by the winds of centuries,
    is hardly pure.</p>
    <p>And then fame cannot be the good of which I speak, for only a very few can even
    hope for it. To nearly all, the gifts which make it possible are denied; and to
    others, the opportunities. Many, indeed, love and win notoriety, but such as they
    need not detain us here. A lower race of youth, in whom the blood is warmer than
    the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> soul,
    think pleasure life's best gift, and are content to let occasion die, while they
    revel in the elysium of the senses. But to make pleasure an end is to thwart one's
    purpose, for joy is good only when it comes unbidden. The pleasure we seek begins
    already to pall. It is good, indeed, if it come as refreshment to the weary, solace
    to the heavy-hearted, and rest to the careworn; but if sought for its own sake, it is
    "the honey of poison flowers and all the measureless ill." Only the young, or the
    depraved, can believe that to live for pleasure is not to be foreordained to misery.
    Whoso loves God or freedom or growth of mind or strength of heart, feels that
    pleasure is his foe.</p>

    <p>Of money, as the end or ideal of life, it should not be necessary to speak. As a
    fine contempt for life, a willingness to throw it away in defence of any just cause
    or noble opinion, is one of the privileges of youth, so the generous heart of the
    young holds cheap the material comforts which money procures. To be young is to be
    free, to be able to live anywhere on land or sea, in the midst of deserts or among
    strange people; is to be able to fit the mind and body to all circumstance, and to
    rise almost above Nature's iron law. He who is impelled by this<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> high and heavenly
    spirit will dream of flying and not of hobbling through life on golden crutches. Let
    the feeble and the old put their trust in money; but where there is strength and
    youth, the soul should be our guide.</p>
    <p>And yet the very law and movement of our whole social life seem to point to riches
    as the chief good.</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like
        these?<br />
        </span> <span class="i0">Every door is barred with gold, and opens but to golden
        keys."<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Money is the god in whom we put our trust, to whom instinctively we pay homage. We
    believe that the rich are fortunate, are happy, that the best of life has been given
    to them. We have faith in the power of money, in its sovereign efficacy to save us
    not only from beggary, from sneers and insults, but we believe that it can transform
    us, and take away the poverty of mind, the narrowness of heart, the dullness of
    imagination, which make us weak, hard, and common. Even our hatred of the rich is but
    another form of the worship of money. The poor think they are wretched, because they
    think money the chief good; and if they are right, then is it a holy work to strive
    to overthrow society as it is now constituted. Buckle and Strauss find fault with the
    Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
    religion because it does not inculcate the love of money. But in this, faith and
    reason are in harmony. Wealth is not the best, and to make it the end of life is
    idolatry, and as Saint Paul declares, the root of evil. Man is more than money, as
    the workman is more than his tools. The soul craves quite other nourishment than that
    which the whole material universe can supply. Man's chief good lies in the infinite
    world of thought and righteousness. Fame and wealth and pleasure are good when they
    are born of high thinking and right living, when they lead to purer faith and love;
    but if they are sought as ends and loved for themselves, they blight and corrupt. The
    value of culture is great, and the ideal it presents points in the right direction in
    bidding us build up the being which we are. But since man is not the highest, he may
    not rest in himself, and culture therefore is a means rather than an end. If we make
    it the chief aim of life, it degenerates into a principle of exclusion, destroys
    sympathy, and terminates in a sort of self-worship.</p>
    <p>What remains, then, but the ideal which I have proposed?&mdash;"Seek ye first the
    Kingdom of God." Unless the light of Heaven fall along our way, thick darkness
    gathers about us, and in the end, whatever our success may have been, we fail, and
    are without God and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
    14]</a></span> without hope. So long as any seriousness is left, religion is man's
    first and deepest concern; to be indifferent is to be dull or depraved, and doubt is
    disease. Difficulties assuredly there are, underlying not only faith, but all systems
    of knowledge. How am I certain that I know anything? is a question, debated in all
    past time, debatable in all future time; but we are none the less certain that we
    know. The mind is governed by laws which neither science nor philosophy can change,
    and while theories and systems rise and pass away, the eternal problems present
    themselves ever anew clothed in the eternal mystery. But little discernment is needed
    to enable us to perceive how poor and symbolic are the thoughts of the multitude.
    Half in pity, half in contempt, we rise to higher regions only to discover that
    wherever we may be there also are the laws and the limitations of our being; and that
    in whatsoever sanctuaries we may take refuge, we are still of the crowd. We cannot
    grasp the Infinite; language cannot express even what we know of the Divine Being,
    and hence there remains a background of darkness, where it is possible to adore, or
    to mock. But religion dispels more mystery than it involves. With it, there is
    twilight in the world; without it, night. We are in the world to act, not to doubt.
    Leaving quibbles to those who can find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15"
    id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> no better use for life, the wise, with firm faith in
    God and man, strive to make themselves worthy to do brave and righteous work.
    Distrust is the last wisdom a great heart learns; and noble natures feel that the
    generous view is, in the end, the true view. For them life means good; they find
    strength and joy in this wholesome and cheerful faith, and if they are in error, it
    can never be known, for if death end all, with it knowledge ceases. Perceiving this,
    they strive to gain spiritual insight, they look to God; toward him they turn the
    current of their thought and love; the unseen world of truth and beauty becomes their
    home; and while matter flows on and breaks and remakes itself to break again, they
    dwell in the presence of the Eternal, and become co-workers with the Infinite Power
    which makes goodness good, and justice right. They love knowledge, because God knows
    all things; they love beauty, because he is its source; they love the soul, because
    it brings man into conscious communion with him and his universe. If their ideal is
    poetical, they catch in the finer spirit of truth which the poet breathes, the
    fragrance of the breath of God; if it is scientific, they discover in the laws of
    Nature the harmony of his attributes; if it is political and social, they trace the
    principles of justice and liberty to him; if it is philan<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>thropic, they understand that love
    which is the basis, aim, and end of life is also God.</p>
    <p>The root of their being is in him, and the illusory world of the senses cannot dim
    their vision of the real world which is eternal. By self-analysis the mind is
    sublimated until it becomes a shadow in a shadowy universe; and the criticism of the
    reason drives us to doubt and inaction, from which we are redeemed by our necessary
    faith in our own freedom, in our power to act, and in the duty of acting in obedience
    to higher law. Knowledge comes of doing. Never to act is never to know. The world of
    which we are conscious is the world against which we throw ourselves by the power of
    the will; hence life is chiefly conduct, and its ideal is not merely religious, but
    moral. The duty of obedience to our better self determines the purpose and end of
    action, for the better self is under the impulse of God. Whether we look without or
    within, we find things are as they should not be; and there awakens the desire, nay,
    the demand that they be made other and better. The actual is a mockery unless it may
    be looked upon as the means of a higher state. If all things come forth only to
    perish and again come forth as they were before; if life is a monster which destroys
    itself that it may again be born, again to destroy itself,&mdash;were it not bet<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ter that the tragedy
    should cease? For many centuries men have been struggling for richer and happier
    life; and yet when we behold the sins, the miseries, the wrongs, the sorrows, of
    which the world is full, we are tempted to think that progress means failure. The
    multitude are still condemned to toil from youth to age to provide the food by which
    life is kept in the body; immortal spirits are still driven by hard necessity to fix
    their thoughts upon matter from which they with much labor dig forth what nourishes
    the animal. Like the savage, we still tremble before the pitiless might of Nature.
    Floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, untimely frosts, destroy in a moment what with long
    and painful effort has been provided. Pestilence still stalks through the earth to
    slay and make desolate. Each day a hundred thousand human beings die; and how many of
    these perish as the victims of sins of ignorance, of selfishness, of sensuality.</p>
    <p>To-day, as of old, it would seem man's worst enemy is man. What hordes still
    wander through Asia and Africa, seeking opportunity for murder and rapine; what
    multitudes are still hunted like beasts, caught and sold into slavery. In Europe
    millions of men stand, arms in hand, waiting for the slaughter. They still believe,
    because they were born on differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18"
    id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>ent sides of a river and speak different languages,
    that they are natural enemies, made to destroy one another. And in our own country,
    what other sufferings and wrongs,&mdash;greed, sensuality, injustice,
    deceit,&mdash;make us enemies one of another! There is a general struggle in which
    each one strives to get the most, heedless of the misery of others. We trade upon the
    weaknesses, the vices, and the follies of our fellow-men; and every attempt at reform
    is met by an army of upholders of abuse. When we consider the murders, the suicides,
    the divorces, the adulteries, the prostitutions, the brawls, the drunkenness, the
    dishonesties, the political and official corruptions, of which our life is full, it
    is difficult to have complacent thoughts of ourselves. Consider, too, our prisons,
    our insane asylums, our poor-houses; the multitudes of old men and women, who having
    worn out strength and health in toil which barely gave them food and raiment, are
    thrust aside, no longer now fit to be bought and sold; the countless young people,
    who have, as we say, been educated, but who have not been taught the principles and
    habits which lead to honorable living; the thousands in our great cities who are
    driven into surroundings which pervert and undermine character. And worse still, the
    good, instead of uniting to labor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19"
    id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> for a better state of things, misunderstand and
    thwart one another. They divide into parties, are jealous and contentious, and waste
    their time and exhaust their strength in foolish and futile controversies. They are
    not anxious that good be done, nor asking nor caring by whom; but they seek credit
    for themselves, and while they seem to be laboring for the general welfare, are
    striving rather to satisfy their own selfish vanity.</p>
    <p>But the knowledge of all this does not discourage him who, guided by the light of
    true ideals, labors to make reason and the will of God prevail. If things are bad he
    knows they have been worse. Never before have the faith and culture which make us
    human, which make us strong and wise, been the possession of so large a portion of
    the race. Religion and civilization have diffused themselves, from little
    centres&mdash;from Athens and Jerusalem and Rome&mdash;until people after people,
    whole continents, have been brought under their influence. And in our day this
    diffusion is so rapid that it spreads farther in a decade than formerly in centuries.
    For ages, mountains and rivers and oceans were barriers behind which tribes and
    nations entrenched themselves against the human foe. But we have tunneled the
    mountains; we have bridged the rivers; we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20"
    id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> tamed the oceans. We hitch steam and electricity to
    our wagons, and in a few days make the circuit of the globe. All lands, all seas, are
    open to us. The race is getting acquainted with itself. We make a comparative study
    of all literatures, of all religions, of all philosophies, of all political systems.
    We find some soul of goodness in whatever struggles and yearnings have tried man's
    heart. As the products of every clime are carried everywhere, like gifts from other
    worlds, so the highest science and the purest religion are communicated and taught
    throughout the earth: and as a result, national prejudices and antagonisms are
    beginning to disappear; wars are becoming less frequent and less cruel; established
    wrongs are yielding to the pressure of opinion; privileged classes are losing their
    hold upon the imagination; and opportunity offers itself to ever-increasing
    numbers.</p>
    <p>Now, in all this, what do we perceive but the purpose of God, urging mankind to
    wider and nobler life? History is his many-chambered school. Here he has taught this
    lesson, and there another, still leading his children out of the darkness of sin and
    ignorance toward the light of righteousness and love, until his kingdom come, until
    his will be done on earth as it is in heaven. To believe in God and in this<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> divine education,
    and to make co-operation with his providential guidance of the race a life-aim is to
    have an ideal which is not only the highest, but which also blends all other true
    ideals into harmony. And the lovers of culture should be the first to perceive that
    intellectual good is empty, illusory, unless there be added to it the good of the
    heart, the good of conscience. To live for the cultivation of one's mind, is, after
    all, to live for one's self, and therefore out of harmony with the eternal law which
    makes it impossible for us to find ourselves except in what is not ourselves. "It is
    the capital fault of all cultivated men," says Goethe, "that they devote their whole
    energies to the carrying out of a mere idea, and seldom or never to the realization
    of practical good." Whatever may be said in praise of culture, of its power to make
    its possessor at home in the world of the best thought, the purest sentiment, the
    highest achievements of the race; of the freedom, the mildness, the reasonableness of
    the temper it begets; of its aim at completeness and perfection,&mdash;it is
    nevertheless true, that if it be sought apart from faith in God and devotion to man,
    its tendency is to produce an artificial and unsympathetic character. The primal
    impulse of our nature is to action; and unless we can make our thought a kind of
    deed, it seems to be vain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
    22]</a></span> and unreal; and unless the harmonious development of all the
    endowments which make the beauty and dignity of human life, give us new strength and
    will to work with God for the good of men, sadness and a sense of failure fall upon
    us. To have a cultivated mind, to be able to see things on many sides, to have wide
    sympathy and the power of generous appreciation,&mdash;is most desirable, and without
    something of all this, not only is our life narrow and uninteresting, but our energy
    is turned in wrong directions, and our very religion is in danger of losing its
    catholicity.</p>
    <p>Culture, then, is necessary. We need it as a corrective of the tendency to seek
    the good of life in what is external, as a means of helping us to overcome our vulgar
    self-complacency, our satisfaction with low aims and cheap accomplishments, our
    belief in the sovereign potency of machines and measures. We need it to make our
    lives less unlovely, less hard, less material; to help us to understand the idolatry
    of the worship of steam and electricity, the utter insufficiency of the ideals of
    industrialism. But if culture is to become a mighty transforming influence it must be
    wedded to religious faith, without which, while it widens the intellectual view, it
    weakens the will to act. To take us out of ourselves and to urge us on to labor
    with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> God that
    we may leave the world better because we have lived, religion alone has power. It
    gives new vigor to the cultivated mind; it takes away the exclusive and fastidious
    temper which a purely intellectual habit tends to produce; it enlarges sympathy; it
    teaches reverence; it nourishes faith, inspires hope, exalts the imagination, and
    keeps alive the fire of love. To lead a noble, a beautiful, and a useful life, we
    should accept and follow the ideals both of religion and of culture. In the midst of
    the transformations of many kinds which are taking place in the civilized world,
    neither the uneducated nor the irreligious mind can be of help. Large and tolerant
    views are necessary; but not less so is the enthusiasm, the earnestness, the charity
    of Christian faith. They who are to be leaders in the great movements upon which we
    have entered, must both know and believe. They must understand the age, must
    sympathize with whatever is true and beneficent in its aspirations, must hail with
    thankfulness whatever help science, and art, and culture can bring; but they must
    also know and feel that man is of the race of God, and that his real and true life is
    in the unseen, infinite, and eternal world of thought and love, with which the actual
    world of the senses must be brought into ever-increasing harmony. Liberty and
    equality are good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
    24]</a></span> wealth is good, and with them we can do much, but not all that needs
    to be done. The spirit of Christ is not merely the spirit of liberty and equality; it
    is more essentially the spirit of love, of sympathy, of goodness; and this spirit
    must breathe upon our social life until it becomes as different from what it is as is
    fragrant spring from cheerless winter. Sympathy must become universal; not merely as
    a sentiment prompting to deeds of helpfulness and mercy, but as the informing
    principle of society until it attains such perfectness that whatever is loss or gain
    for one, shall be felt as loss or gain for all. The narrow, exclusive self must lose
    itself in wider aims, in generous deeds, in the comprehensive love of God and man.
    The good must no longer thwart one another; the weak must be protected; the wicked
    must be surrounded by influences which make for righteousness; and the forces of
    Nature itself must more and more be brought under man's control. Pestilence and
    famine must no longer bring death and desolation; men must no longer drink impure
    water and adulterated liquors, no longer must they breathe the poisonous air of badly
    constructed houses; dwellings which are now made warm in winter, must be made cool in
    summer; miasmatic swamps must be drained; saloons, which stand like painted harlots
    to lure men to sin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
    25]</a></span> death, must be closed. Women must have the same rights and privileges
    as men; children must no longer be made the victims of mammon and offered in
    sacrifice in his temple, the factory; ignorance, which is the most fruitful cause of
    misery, must give place to knowledge; war must be condemned as public murder, and our
    present system of industrial competition must be considered worse than war; the
    social organization, which makes the few rich, and dooms the many to the slavery of
    poorly paid toil, must cease to exist; and if the political state is responsible for
    this cruelty, it must find a remedy, or be overthrown; society must be made to rest
    upon justice and love, without which it is but organized wrong. These principles must
    so thoroughly pervade our public life that it can no more be the interest of any one
    to wrong his fellow, to grow rich at the cost of the poverty and misery of another.
    Life must be prolonged both by removing many of the physical causes of death, and by
    making men more rational and religious, more willing and able to deny themselves
    those indulgences which are but a kind of slow suicide.</p>
    <p>Never before have questions so vast, so complex, so pregnant with meaning, so
    fraught with the promise of good, presented themselves; and it can hardly be vanity
    or conceit which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
    26]</a></span> prompts us to believe that in this mighty movement toward a social
    life in harmony with our idea of God and with the aspirations of the soul, America is
    the divinely appointed leader. But if this faith is not to be a mere delusion, it
    must become for the best among us the impulse to strong and persevering effort. Not
    by millionaires and not by politicians shall this salvation be wrought; but by men
    who to pure religion add the best intellectual culture. The American youth must learn
    patience; he must acquire that serene confidence in the power of labor, which makes
    workers willing to wait. He must not, like a foolish child, rush forward to pluck the
    fruit before it is ripe, lest this be his epitaph: The promise of his early life was
    great, his performance insignificant.</p>
    <p>Do not our young men lack noble ambition? Are they not satisfied with low aims? To
    be a legislator; to be a governor; to be talked about; to live in a marble
    house,&mdash;seems to them a thing to be desired. Unhappy youths from whom the power
    and goodness of life are hidden, who, standing in the presence of the unseen,
    infinite world of truth and beauty, can only dream some aldermanic nightmare. They
    thrust themselves into the noisy crowd, and are thrown into contact with
    disenchanting experience at a time of life when the mind and heart should draw
    nour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ishment
    and wisdom from communion with God and with great thoughts. Amid the universal
    clatter of tongues, and in the overflowing ceaseless stream of newspaper gossip, the
    soul is bewildered and stifled. In a blatant land, the young should learn to be
    silent. The noblest minds are fashioned in secrecy, through long travail
    like,&mdash;</p>

    <p>Is it not worth the labor and expectation of a life-time to be able to do, even
    once, the right thing excellently well? The eager passion for display, the desire to
    speak and act in the eyes of the world, is boyish. Will is concentration, and a great
    purpose works in secrecy. Oh, the goodness and the seriousness of life, the
    illimitable reach of achievement, which it opens to the young who have a great heart
    and noble aims! With them is God's almighty power and love, and his very presence is
    hidden from them by a film only. From this little islet they look out upon infinite
    worlds; heaven bends over them, and earth bears them up as though it would have them
    fly. How is it possible to remain inferior when we believe in God and know that this
    age is the right moment for all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28"
    id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> high and holy work? The yearning for guidance has
    never been so great. We have reached heights where the brain swims, and thoughts are
    confused, and it is held to be questionable whether we are to turn backward or to
    move onward to the land of promise; whether we are to be overwhelmed by the material
    world which we have so marvelously transformed, or with the aid of the secrets we
    have learned, are to rise Godward to a purer and fairer life of knowledge, justice,
    and love.</p>
    <p>Is the material progress of the nineteenth century a cradle or a grave? Are we to
    continue to dig and delve and peer into matter until God and the soul fade from our
    view and we become like the things we work in? To put such questions to the multitude
    were idle. There is here no affair of votes and majorities. Human nature has not
    changed, and now, as in the past, crowds follow leaders. What the best minds and the
    most energetic characters believe and teach and put in practice, the millions will
    come to accept. The doubt is whether the leaders will be worthy,&mdash;the real
    permanent leaders, for the noisy apparent leaders can never be so. And here we touch
    the core of the problem which Americans have to solve. No other people has such
    numbers who are ready to thrust themselves forward as leaders, no other<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> has so few who are
    really able to lead. In mitigation of this fact, it may be said with truth, that
    nowhere else is it so difficult to lead; for nowhere else does force rule so little.
    Every one has opinions; the whole nation is awakened; thousands are able to discuss
    any subject with plausibility; and to be simply keen-witted and versatile is to be of
    the crowd. We need men whose intellectual view embraces the history of the race, who
    are familiar with all literature, who have studied all social movements, who are
    acquainted with the development of philosophic thought, who are not blinded by
    physical miracles and industrial wonders, but know how to appreciate all truth, all
    beauty, all goodness. And to this wide culture they must join the earnestness, the
    confidence, the charity, and the purity of motive which Christian faith inspires. We
    need scholars who are saints, and saints who are scholars. We need men of genius who
    live for God and their country; men of action who seek for light in the company of
    those who know; men of religion who understand that God reveals himself in science,
    and works in Nature as in the soul of man, for the good of those who love him. Let us
    know the right moment, and let us know that it comes for those alone who are
    prepared.</p>

        <p>Learning is acquaintance with what others have felt, thought, and done; knowledge
    is the result of what we ourselves have felt, thought, and done. Hence a man knows
    best what he has taught himself; what personal contact with God, with man, and with
    Nature has made his own. The important thing, then, is not so much to know the
    thoughts and loves of others, as to be able ourselves to think truly, and to love
    nobly. The aim should be to rouse, strengthen, and illumine the mind rather than to
    store it with learning; and the great educational problem has been, and is, how to
    give to the soul purity of intention, to the conscience steadfastness, and to the
    mind force, pliability, and openness to light; or in other words, how to bring
    philosophy and religion to the aid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31"
    id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> the will so that the better self shall prevail and
    each generation introduce its successor to a higher plane of life.</p>
    <p>To this end the efforts of all teachers have, with more or less consciousness,
    tended; and in this direction too, along winding ways and with periods of arrest or
    partial return, the race of man has for ages been moving; and he who aspires to gain

    <p>may be rash, but his spirit is not ignoble. To him it may not be given "to fan and
    winnow from the coming step of Time the chaff of custom;" but if he persevere he may
    confidently hope that his thought and love shall at length rise to fairer and more
    enduring worlds. He weds himself to things of light, seeks aids to true life within,
    learns to live with the noble dead, and with the great souls of the present who have
    uttered the truth whereby they live, in a way more intimate and higher than that
    granted to those who are with them day by day; for minds are not separated by time
    and space, but by quality of thought. But to be able to love this life, and with all
    one's heart to seek this close communion with God, with noble souls, and with Nature
    is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> easy,
    and it may be that it is impossible for those who are not drawn to it by irresistible
    instincts. For the intellect, at least, attractions are proportional to destiny; and
    the art of intellectual life is not most surely learned by those whom circumstances
    favor, but by those whom will impels onward to exercise of mind; whom neither daily
    wants, nor animal appetites, nor hope of gain, nor low ambition, nor sneers of
    worldlings, nor prayers of friends, nor aught else can turn from the pursuit of
    wisdom; who, with ceaseless labor and with patient thought, eat their way in silence,
    like caterpillars, to the light, become their own companions, walk uplifted by their
    own thoughts, and by slow and imperceptible processes are transformed and grow to be
    the embodiment of the truth and beauty which they see and love.</p>
    <p>The overmastering love of mental exercise, of the good of the intellect, is
    probably never found in formal and prosaic minds; or if so, its first awakening is in
    the early years when to think is to feel, when the soul, fresh from God, comes
    trailing clouds of glory, and the sun and moon and stars, and the hills and flowing
    waters seem but made to crown with joy hearts that love. It is in these dewy dawns
    that the image of beauty is imprinted on the soul and the sense of mystery awakens.
    We move about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
    and become a part of all we see, grow akin to stones and leaves and birds, and to all
    young and happy things. We lose ourselves in life which is poured round us like an
    unending sea; are natural, healthful, alive to all we see and touch; have no
    misgivings, but walk as though the eternal God held us by the hand. These are the
    fair spring days when we suck honey that shall nourish us in the winters of which we
    do not dream; when sunsets interfuse themselves with all our being until we are dyed
    in the many-tinted glory; when the miracle of the changing year is the soul's fair
    seed-time; when lying in the grass, the head resting in clasped hands, while soft
    white clouds float lazily through azure skies, and the birds warble, and the waters
    murmur, and the flowers breathe fragrance, we feel a kind of unconscious
    consciousness of a universal life in Nature. The very rocks seem to be listening to
    what the leaves whisper; and through the silent eternities we almost see the dead
    becoming the living, the living the dead, until both grow to be one, and whatever is,
    is life.</p>
    <p>He who has never had these visions; has never heard these airy voices; has never
    seemed about to catch a glimpse of the inner heart of being, pulsing beneath the veil
    of visible things; has never felt that he himself is a spirit looking<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> blindly on a
    universe, which if his eyes could but see and his ears hear, would be revealed as the
    very heaven of the infinite God,&mdash;must forever lack something of the freshness,
    of the eager delight, with which a poetic mind contemplates the world and follows
    whither the divine intimations point. This early intercourse with Nature nourishes
    the soul, deepens the intellect, exalts the imagination, and fills the memory with
    fair and noble forms and images which abide with us, and as years pass on, gain in
    softness and purity what they may lose in distinctness of outline and color. This is
    the source of intellectual wealth, of tranquil moods, of patience in the midst of
    opposition, of confidence in the fruitfulness of labor and the transforming power of
    time. Here is given the material which must be molded into form; the rude blocks
    which must be cut and dressed and fitted together until they become a spiritual
    temple wherein the soul may rest at one with God and Nature, and with its own thought
    and love. To run, to jump, to ride, to swim, to skate, to sit in the shade of trees
    by flowing water, to watch reapers at their work, to look on orchards blossoming, to
    dream in the silence that lies amid the hills, to feel the solemn loneliness of deep
    woods, to follow cattle as they crop the sweet-scented clover,&mdash;to learn to
    know, as one knows a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
    35]</a></span> mother's face, every change that comes over the heavens from the dewy
    freshness of early dawn to the restful calm of evening, from the overpowering mystery
    of the starlit sky to the tender human look with which the moon smiles upon the
    earth,&mdash;all this is education of a higher and altogether more real kind than it
    is possible to receive within the walls of a school; and lacking this, nothing shall
    have power to develop the faculties of the soul in symmetry and completeness. Hence a
    philosopher has said there are ten thousand chances to one that genius, talent, and
    virtue shall issue from a farmhouse rather than from a palace. The daily intercourse
    with Nature in childhood and youth intertwines with noble and enduring objects the
    passions which form the mind and heart of man, whereas those who are shut out from
    such communion are necessarily thrown into contact with what is mean and vulgar; and
    since our early years, whatever our surroundings may have been, seem to us sweet and
    fair because life itself is then a clear-flowing fountain, they cannot help blending
    the memory of that innocent and happy time with thoughts of base and mechanical
    objects, or, it may be, of low and ignoble associates.</p>
    <p>He is fortunate who, during the first ten years of his life, escapes the
    confinement and repres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg
    36]</a></span>sion of school, and lives at home in the country amid the fields and
    the woods, day by day growing familiar with the look on Nature's face, with all her
    moods, with every common object, with living things in the air and the water and on
    the earth; who sees the corn sprout, and watches it grow week after week until the
    yellow harvest waves in the sunlight; who looks with unawed eye on rising
    thunder-clouds and shouts with glee amid the lightning's play; who learns to know
    that whatever he looks upon is thereby humanized, and to feel that he is part of all
    he sees and loves. He will carry with him to the study of the intellectual and
    spiritual world of men's thoughts shut up in books, a strength of mind, a depth and
    freshness of heart which only those can own who have drunk at Nature's deep flowing
    fountain, and come up to life's training-course wet with her dews and with the
    fragrance of her flowers on their breath. In the eyes of the old Greeks, who first
    made education a science, the scholar was an idler,&mdash;one who had leisure to look
    about him, to stroll amid the olive groves, to let his eye rest upon the purple hills
    or the blue sea studded with green isles, to listen to the brooks and the
    nightingales, to read the lesson the fair earth teaches more than that imprinted on
    parchment; and the school must still preserve something of this freedom from<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> constraint, must
    encourage the play of body and of mind, the delight natural to the young in the
    exercise of strength of whatever kind, and thus as far as possible lighten the labor
    and drudgery of elementary studies with thoughts of liberty, of beauty, and of
    excellence. Let the boy feel how good it is to be alive though life meant only the
    narrow world and the mere surfaces of things with which alone it is possible for him
    to be acquainted; and then when we ask him to believe that in high thinking and in
    noble acting he will find a life infinitely more worthy, his eager soul will be
    inflamed with a desire for knowledge and virtue, and bearing in his heart the
    strength and wealth of imagination gained from his early experience, his thoughts
    will turn to great and good men. Dim visions of mighty conquerors, of poets at whose
    song the woods and waves grow calm, of orators whose words with storm-like force,
    whatever way they take, sweep with them the wills of men,&mdash;will rise before his
    mind. His young fancy will endow them with preternatural qualities; and he will yearn
    to draw near, to mingle with them and to catch the secret of their divine power. The
    germ of the godlike within his bosom bursts and springs. What they were, why may not
    he also become? What bars are thrown athwart his path, what obstacles hem his way,
    which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> whoever
    in any age has excelled, has not had to break down and surmount? Here the wise
    teacher comes to cheer him, to tell him his faith is not wrong, his hope not without
    promise of attainment if he but trust himself, and bend his whole mind to the task;
    that whatever goal within the scope of human power, the will sets to itself, it may
    reach.</p>
    <p>In order to develop, strengthen, and confirm this high mood, this noble temper,
    let him by all means be made acquainted with the language and genius of Greece. Here
    he will be introduced to a world of thought and sentiment almost as fresh, as fair
    and many-sided as Nature herself,&mdash;the fragrant blossoming in myriad hues and
    forms of the life and mind of the most richly endowed portion of the human race. Not
    only are the Greeks the most highly-gifted of all people, but in this classical age
    they have also this special charm and power,&mdash;that the keenest intellectual
    faculties are in them united with the feelings, hopes, and fancies of a noble and
    great-hearted youth. Even Socrates and Plato talk like high-souled boys who can see
    the world only in the light of ideals, for whom what the mind beholds and the heart
    loves is alone real. How healthfully they look on life, with what delight they
    breathe the air! What fine contempt have they not of<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> death, thinking no fortune so good as
    that which comes to the hero who dies in a worthy cause! There is Athens, already the
    world's university; but no books, no libraries, no lecture-halls, only great teachers
    who walk about followed by a crowd of youths eager to drink in their words. Here is
    the Acropolis, with its snow-white temples and propyl&aelig;um, fair and chaste as
    though they had been built in heaven and gently lowered to this Attic mound by the
    hands of angels. There in the Parthenon are the sculptures of Phidias, and yonder in
    the temple of the Dioscuri, the paintings of Polygnotus,&mdash;ideal beauty bodied
    forth to lure the souls of men to unseen and eternal worlds. If they turn to the
    east, the isles of the &AElig;gean look up to them like virgins who welcome happy
    lovers; to the west, Mount Pentelicus, from whose heart the architectural glory of
    the city has been carved, bids them think what patience will enable man's genius to
    accomplish; and to the north, Hymettus, fragrant with the breath of a thousand herbs
    and musical with the hum of bees, stoops with gentle undulations to their feet. They
    live in the air; their temples are open to the sunlight; their theatres are uncovered
    to the heavens; and whithersoever they move, they are surrounded by what is fair,
    noble, and inspiring. This free and happy life in the<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> company of great teachers becomes the
    stimulus to the keenest exercise of mind. They are as eager to see things in a true
    light as they are quick to sympathize with whatever is heroic or beautiful; and all
    their talk is of truth and justice, the good, the fair, the excellent, of philosophy,
    religion, poetry, and art, and of whatever else seems favorable to human life and to
    the development of ideal manhood. Of the merely useful they have the scorn of young
    and inexperienced minds; and Hippocrates proclaims himself ready to give Protagoras,
    not only whatever he himself possesses, but also the property of his friends, if he
    will but teach him wisdom. Superior knowledge was to them of all things the most
    admirable and the most to be desired. What noble thoughts have they not concerning
    education? "An intelligent man," says Plato, "will prize those studies which result
    in his soul getting soberness, righteousness, and wisdom, and will less value the
    others." The culture of the mind is made a kind of religion, in the spreading of
    which the personal influence of the teacher is not less active than the truths he
    sets forth. Bonds of affection bind the disciple to the master whose words have for
    him the sacredness of wisdom and the charm of genius, power to confirm the will, and
    warmth and color whereby the imagination is raised.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
    <p>This secret of making knowledge attractive, of clothing truth in chaste and
    beautiful language, of associating it with whatever is fair and noble in Nature, and
    of relating it to life and conduct, which is part of the genius of Greece, still
    lives in her literature; and to read the words of her poets, orators, and
    philosophers is to feel the presence of a high and active spirit, is to breathe in an
    intellectual atmosphere of light and liberty, is of itself enlargement and
    cultivation of mind. Hence, in the realms of thought, the Greeks are the civilizers
    and emancipators of the world; and whoever thinks, is to some extent their debtor.
    The music of their eloquence and poetry can never grow silent; the forms of beauty
    their genius has created can never perish, and never cease to win the admiration and
    love of noble minds and gentle hearts, or to be the inspiration, generation after
    generation, to high thoughts and heroic moods. So long as glory, beauty, freedom,
    light, and gladness shall seem good and fair, so long will the finer spirits of the
    world feel the attraction and the charm of Greece, and know the sweet surprise which
    thrilled the heart of Keats when first he read Homer:&mdash;</p>

    <p>In a less degree, Roman literature, which is the offspring of Greek culture, has
    value as an intellectual stimulus and discipline. Here also the youthful mind is
    brought into the presence of a great and noble people, who, if they have less genius
    and a duller sense of beauty than the Greeks, excel them in steadiness of purpose, in
    dignity of character, in reverence for law and religion, and above all in the art of
    governing.</p>
    <p>The educational value of the classics does not lie so much in the Greek and Latin
    languages as in the type of mind, the sense of proportion and beauty, the heroic
    temper, the philosophic mood, the keen relish for high enterprise, and the joyful
    love of life which they make known to us. The world to which they introduce us is so
    remote that the pre-occupations and vulgarities of the present, by which we all are
    hemmed and warped, fall away from us; and it is at the same time so real and of such
    absorbing interest that we are caught up in spirit and carried to the Attic Plain and
    the hills of Latium. They are useful, not because they teach us anything that may not
    be learned and learned more accurately from modern books, but because they move the
    mind, fire the heart, ennoble and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
    id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> refine the imagination in a way which nothing else
    has power to do. They are sources of inspiration; they first roused the modern mind
    to activity; and the potency of their influence can never cease to be felt by those
    whose aptitudes lead them to the love of intellectual perfection, who delight in the
    free play of the mind, who are attracted by what is symmetrical, who have the
    instinct for beauty, who swim in a current of ideas as naturally as birds fly in the
    air. They appeal to the mind as a whole, stimulate all its faculties, awaken a
    many-sided sympathy both with Nature and with the world of men. They widen our view
    of life, bring forth in us the consciousness of our kinship with the human race, and
    of the application to ourselves, however common and uninspiring our surroundings may
    be, of the best thoughts and noblest deeds which have ever sprung from the brain and
    heart of man. They help to make one, again to quote Plato, "A lover, not of a part of
    wisdom, but of the whole; who has a taste for every sort of knowledge, and is curious
    to learn and is never satisfied; who has magnificence of mind, and is a spectator of
    all time and all existence; who is harmoniously constituted, of a well-proportioned
    and gracious mind, whose own nature will move spontaneously toward the true being of
    everything; who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg
    44]</a></span> a good memory, and is quick to learn, noble, gracious, the friend of
    truth, justice, courage, temperance." The ideal presented is that of complete
    harmonious culture, the aim of which is not to make an artisan, a physician, a
    merchant, a lawyer, but a man alive in all his faculties, touching the world at many
    points, for whom all knowledge is desirable, all beauty lovable, and for whom fine
    bearing and noble acting are indispensable.</p>
    <p>It is needless to point out in what, or why, the Greeks failed, since here there
    is question only of intellectual life, and in this they did not fail. Nor is there
    any thought, in what has here been said, of depreciating the worth of the study of
    science, without a certain knowledge of which no one, in this age, can in any true
    sense, be called educated. Whoever, indeed, learns a language properly, acquires
    scientific knowledge; and the Greeks are not only the masters in poetry and
    eloquence, they are also the guides to the right use of reason and to scientific
    method, and the teachers of mathematics, logic, and physics. He who pursues culture,
    in the Greek spirit, who desires to see things as they are, to know the best that has
    been thought and done by men, will fear nothing so much as the exclusion of any
    truth, and he will be anxious to acquaint himself not only with the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> method, but as far
    as possible with the facts, of physical science. Still he perceives that however
    great the value of natural knowledge may be, it is, as an instrument of culture,
    inferior to literature. We are educated by what calls forth in us love and
    admiration, by what creates the exalted mood and the steadfast purpose. In bowing
    with reverence to what is above us, we are uplifted. When we are moved, we are more
    alive; we are stronger, tenderer, nobler. Now to look upon Nature with the detective
    eye of the man of science is to be cold and unsympathetic; to learn by methodic
    experiment is to gain knowledge, which, since it is only remotely or indirectly
    related to life, is but little interesting. Such knowledge is a fragment, and a
    fragment extremely difficult to fit into the temple built by thought and love, by
    hope and imagination; and hence when we have learned a great deal about chemical
    elements, geologic epochs, correlation of forces, and sidereal spaces, we are rather
    astonished than enlightened. We are brought into the presence of a world which is not
    that of the senses, nor yet that which faith, hope, and love forebode; and the
    bearing it may have upon human life is of more interest to us than the facts made
    known. We are, indeed, curious to know whatever may, with any certainty, be told us
    of atoms and biogenesis;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
    46]</a></span> but our real concern is to learn what significance such truth may have
    in its relation to questions of God and the soul.</p>
    <p>There is doubtless a disciplinary value in the study of physical science. It
    trains the mind to habits of patient attention, of careful observation, teaches the
    danger of hasty generalization, and diminishes intellectual conceit; but these
    results may also be obtained by other means. The aim of education is not simply to
    develop this or the other faculty, however indispensable, nor yet to make one
    thoroughly conversant with a particular order of facts, but the aim is to bring about
    a conscious participation in the life of the race, to evoke all the powers of man, so
    that his whole being shall be quickened and made responsive to the touch of things
    seen and unseen; and the study of science is less adapted to the attainment of this
    end than the study of human letters. The scientific temper draws to specialties; and
    specialists are narrow, are incomplete. They, each in his own line, do good work, and
    are the chief agents for the increase of natural knowledge, and are, we may grant,
    leaders in every kind of improvement; but like the operatives who provide our
    comforts and luxuries, they are themselves warped and crippled by what they do. The
    habit of looking at a single order of facts, coldly<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> and always from the same point of
    view, takes from the mind flexibility, weakens the imagination, and puts fetters on
    the soul; and hence though it is important that there be specialists, the kind of
    education by which they are formed, while it is suited to make a geologist, a
    chemist, a mathematician, or a botanist, is not suited to call forth the free and
    harmonious play of all man's powers. We do not live on facts alone, much less on
    facts of a single kind. Religion and poetry, love, hope, and imagination are as
    essential to our well-being as science. Human life is knowledge, is faith, is
    conduct, is beauty, is manners; it unfolds itself in many directions and shoots its
    roots into infinitude; and for the general purposes of education, science is learned
    to best advantage when it is embodied in literature, and its methods and results,
    rather than the details of its work, are presented to us. Whatever it is able to do,
    to improve the mind, to widen the range of thought, to give true notions of the
    workings of Nature,&mdash;it will do for whoever learns accurately its general
    conceptions and results; and these cannot remain unknown to him whose aim is culture,
    for such an one is, as Plato says, "A lover not of a part of wisdom, but of the
    whole, and has a taste for every sort of knowledge, and is curious to learn, and is
    never satisfied; and though he will not know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48"
    id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> medicine like a physician, or the heavens like an
    astronomer, or the vegetable kingdom like a botanist, his mind will play over all
    these realms with freedom, and he will know how to relate the principles and facts of
    all the sciences to our sense for beauty, for conduct, for life and religion in a way
    which a mere specialist can never find." And his view will not only be wider and less
    impeded, it will also be deeper than that of the man of science; for he who sees but
    one order of things sees only their surfaces, just as he who sees but one thing sees
    nothing at all.</p>
    <p>It would be a mistake to imagine that the ideal here commended, means superficial
    accomplishments, an excessive love of style and the ornaments of poetry and
    eloquence, or preoccupation in favor of aught external or frivolous. It is the very
    opposite of dilettantism, and if it mean anything, means thoroughness, and a
    thoroughness which can come only of untiring labor carried on through many years; for
    time and intercourse with men and varied experience are indispensable elements. It is
    like the ideal of religion which makes the saint think himself a sinner; it is as
    exacting as the miser's thought which makes millions seem to be beggary; like the
    artist's vision, like the poet's dream, it allures and yet forbids hope of<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> attainment. The
    seeker after wisdom must have a high purpose, a strong soul, and the purest love of
    truth. He cannot live in the senses alone, nor in the mind, nor in the heart alone,
    but the spiritual being, which is himself, yearns for whatever is good, whatever is
    true, whatever is fair, and so he finds himself akin to the infinite God and to all
    that he has made. When his thought is carried out to atoms weaving the garment which
    is our body, and molding the world we see and touch; when he beholds motion lighting,
    warming, thrilling the universe,&mdash;he is filled with intellectual joy, but at the
    same time he perceives that all this is but a phase of truth; that God and the
    boundless facts are infinitely more than drilled atomics marshaled rank on rank until
    they form the countless hosts of the heavens. When the men of science have labeled
    the elements, and put tickets upon all natural compounds, and with complacency
    declare that this is the whole truth, he looks on the flowers around him and the
    blooming children, on the stars above his head, on the sun slow wheeling down the
    western horizon, on the moon climbing some eastern hill, and his inmost soul is glad
    because he feels the thrill of the infinite, living Spirit, and forebodes to what
    fair countries we are bound.</p>
    <p>And when they proclaim the wonders science<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50"
    id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> has wrought,&mdash;increase of physical enjoyment and
    social comfort; the yoking of lightning and steam to make them work for man; the
    providing of more abundant food; the building of more wholesome dwellings; the
    lengthening of life; temporal benefits of every kind,&mdash;he joins with those who
    utter praise, but knows that infinitely more than all this goes to the making of
    man's life. So he turns his mind in many directions, and while he looks on the truth
    in science, does not grow blind to the truth in religion; while he knows the value of
    what is practically useful, understands also the priceless worth of what is noble and
    beautiful, and his acquaintance with many kinds of thought, with many shades of
    opinion confirms him, as Joubert says, in the acceptance of the best.</p>

    <p>He teaches to good purpose who inspires the love of excellence, and who sends his
    pupils forth from the school's narrow walls with such desire for self-improvement
    that the whole world becomes to them a God-appointed university. And why shall not
    every youth hope to enter the narrow circle of those for whom to live, is to think,
    who behold "the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful
    studies." An enlightened mind is like a fair and pleasant friend who comes to cheer
    us in every hour of loneliness and gloom; it is like noble birth which admits to all
    best company; it is like wealth which surrounds us with whatever is rarest and most
    precious; it is like virtue which lives in an atmosphere of light and serenity, and
    is itself enough for itself. Whatever our labors, our cares, our disappointments, a
    free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> and open
    mind, by holding us in communion with the highest and the fairest, will fill the soul
    with strength and joy. The artist, day by day, year in and year out, hangs over his
    work, and finds enough delight in the beauty he creates; and shall not the friend of
    the soul be glad in striving ceaselessly to make his knowledge and his love less
    unlike the knowledge and the love of God? Seldom is opportunity of victory offered to
    great captains, the orator rarely finds fit theme and audience, hardly shall the hero
    meet with occasions worthy of the sacrifice of life; but he who labors to shape his
    mind to the heavenly forms of truth and beauty beholds them ever present and
    appealing. Life without thought and love is worthless; and to the best men and women
    belong only those who cultivate with earnestness and perseverance their spiritual
    faculties, who strive daily to know more, to love more, to be more beautiful. They
    are the chosen ones, and all others, even though they sit on thrones, are but the
    crowd.</p>
    <p>Without a free and open mind there is no high and glad human life. You may as well
    point to the savage drowsing in his tent, or to cattle knee-deep in clover, and bid
    me think them high, as to ask me to admire where I can behold neither intelligence
    nor love. All that we possess is qualified by what we are. Gold<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> makes not the miser
    rich, nor its lack a true man poor; and he who has gained insight into the fair truth
    that he is a part of all he sees and loves, is richer than kings, and lives like a
    god in his universe. Possibilities for us are measured by the kind of work in which
    we put our hearts. If a man's thoughts are wholly busy with carpentering do not
    expect him to become anything else than a carpenter; but if his aim is to build up
    his own being, to make his mind luminous, his heart tender and pure, his will
    steadfast, who but God shall fix a limit beyond which he may not hope to go.
    Education, indeed, cannot confer organic power; but it alone gives us the faculty to
    perceive how infinitely wonderful and fair are man's endowments, how boundless his
    inheritance, how full of deathless hope is that to which he may aspire. Religion,
    philosophy, poetry, science,&mdash;all bring us into the presence of an ideal of
    ceaseless growth toward an all-perfect Infinite, dimly discerned and unapproachable,
    but which fascinates the soul and haunts the imagination with its deep mystery, until
    what we long for becomes more real than all that we possess, and yearning is our
    highest happiness. Ah! who would throw a veil over the vision on which young eyes
    rest when young hearts feel that ideal things alone are real? Who would rob them of
    this divine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
    principle of progress which makes growth the best of life?</p>
    <div class="poem">

    <p>In all ages, we know those made wise by experience, which teaches us to expect
    little, whether of ourselves or others, have made the thoughts and hopes of youth a
    jest, even as men have made religion a jest, having nothing to offer us in
    compensation for its loss, but witticisms and despair. This is the fatal fault of
    life, that when we have obtained what is good,&mdash;as wealth, position, wife, and
    friends,&mdash;we lose all hope of the best, and with our mockery discourage those
    who have ideal aims; who, remembering how the soul felt in life's dawn, retain a
    sense of God's presence in the world, to whom with growing faculties they aspire,
    feeling that whatsoever point they reach, they still have something to pursue. This
    is the principle of the diviner mind in all high and heroic natures; this is the
    spring-head of deeds that make laws, of "thoughts that enrich the blood of the
    world;" this is the power which gives to resolve the force of destiny, and clothes
    the soul with the heavenliest strength and beauty when it stands single and alone, of
    men abandoned and almost of God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55"
    id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
    <p>There is little danger that too many shall ever hearken to the invitation from the
    fair worlds to which all souls belong, and where alone they can be luminous and free.
    For centuries, now, what innumerable voices have pleaded with men to make themselves
    worthy of heaven; while they have moved on heedless of the heaven that lies about us
    here, placing their hopes and aims in material and perishable elements, athirst
    neither for truth, nor beauty, nor aught that is divinely good! They sleep, they
    wake, they eat, they drink; they tread the beaten path with ceaseless iteration, and
    so they die. If one come appealing for culture of intellect, not because they who
    know, are stronger than the ignorant and make them their servants, but because an
    open, free, and flexible mind is good and fair, better than birth, position, and
    wealth, they turn away as though he trifled with their common-sense. Life, they say,
    is not for knowledge, but knowledge for life; and they neither truly know, nor live.
    And if here and there some nobler soul stand forth, he degrades himself to an
    aspirant to fame, forgetting truth and love.</p>

    <p>With unresting, wearing thought and labor we are striving to make earth more
    habitable. We drag forth from its inner parts whatever treasures are hidden there;
    with steam's mighty force we mold brute matter into every fair and serviceable form;
    we build great cities, we spread the fabric of our trade; the engine's iron heart
    goes throbbing through tunneled mountains and over storm-swept seas to bear us and
    our wealth to all regions of the globe; we talk to one another from city to city, and
    from continent to continent along ocean's oozy depths the lightning flashes our
    words, spreading beneath our eyes each morning the whole world's gossip,&mdash;but in
    the midst of this miraculous transformation, we ourselves remain small, hard, and
    narrow, without great thoughts or great loves or immortal hopes. We are a crowd where
    the highest and the best lose individuality, and are swept along as though
    democracy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> were
    a tyranny of the average man under which superiority of whatever kind is criminal.
    Our population increases, our cities grow, our roads are lengthened, our machinery is
    made more perfect, the number of our schools is multiplied, our newspapers are read
    in ever-widening circles, the spirit of humanity and of freedom breathes through our
    life; but the individual remains common-place and uninteresting. He lacks
    intelligence, has no perception of what is excellent, no faith in ideals, no
    reverence for genius, no belief in any highest sort of man who has not shown his
    worth in winning wealth, position, or notoriety. We have a thousand poets and no
    poetry, a thousand orators and no eloquence, a thousand philosophers and no
    philosophy. Every city points to its successful men who have millions, but are
    themselves poor and unintelligent; to its writers who, having sold their talent to
    newspapers and magazines, sink to the level of those they address, dealing only with
    what is of momentary interest, or if the question be deep, they move on the surface,
    lest the many-eyed crowd lose sight of them. The preacher gets an audience and pay on
    condition that he stoop to the gossip which centres around new theories, startling
    events, and mechanical schemes for the improvement of the country. If to get money
    be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> the end of
    writing and preaching, then must we seek to please the multitude who are willing to
    pay those who entertain and amuse them. Will not our friends, even, conceive a mean
    opinion of our ability, if we fail to gain public recognition?</p>
    <p>So we make ourselves "motleys to the view, and sell cheap what is most dear." We
    must, perforce, show the endowment which can be brought to perfection only if it be
    permitted to grow in secrecy and solitude. The worst foe of excellence is the desire
    to appear; for when once we have made men talk of us, we seem to be doing nothing if
    they are silent, and thus the love of notoriety becomes the bane of true work and
    right living. To be one of a crowd is not to be at all; and if we are resolved to put
    our thoughts and acts to the test of reason, and to live for what is permanently true
    and great, we must consent, like the best of all ages, to be lonely in the world. All
    life, except the life of thought and love, is dull and superficial. The young love
    for a while, and are happy; a few think; and for the rest existence is but the
    treadmill of monotonous sensation. There are but few, who, through work and
    knowledge, through faith and hope and love, seek to escape from the narrowness and
    misery of life to the summits of thought where the soul breathes a<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> purer air, and
    whence is seen the fairer world the multitude forebodes. There are but few whose life

    <p>Only the noblest souls awaken within us divine aspirations. They are the music,
    the poetry, which warms and illumines whole generations; they are the few who, born
    with rich endowments, by ceaseless labor develop their powers until they become
    capable of work which, were it not for them, could not be done at all. History is the
    biography of aristocrats, of the chosen ones with whom all improvement originates,
    who found States, establish civilizations, create literatures, and teach wisdom. They
    work not for themselves; for in spite of human selfishness and the personal aims of
    the ambitious, the poet, the scholar, and the statesman bless the world. They lead us
    through happy isles; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
    60]</a></span> clothe our thoughts and hopes with beauty and with strength; they
    dissipate the general gloom; they widen the sphere of life; they bring the multitude
    beneath the sway of law.</p>
    <p>Now, here in America, once for all, whatever the thoughtless may imagine, we have
    lost faith in the worth of artificial distinctions. Indeed plausible arguments may be
    found to prove that the kind of man democracy tends to form, has no reverence for
    distinctions of whatever kind, and is without ideals, and that as he is envious of
    men made by money, so he looks with the contempt of unenlightened common-sense upon
    those whom character and intellect raise above him. This is not truth. The higher you
    lift the mass, the more will they acknowledge and appreciate worth, the clearer will
    they see that what makes man human, beautiful, and beneficent is conduct and
    intelligence; and so increasing enlightenment will turn thought and admiration from
    position and wealth, from the pomp and show of life to what makes a man's self, his
    character, his mind, his manners even,&mdash;for the source of manners lies within
    us. In a society like ours, the chosen ones, the best, the models of life, and the
    leaders of thought will be distinguished from the crowd not by accident or
    circumstance, but by inner strength and beauty, by finer knowledge, by purer love,
    by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> a deeper
    faith in God, by a more steadfast trust that it must, and shall be, well with a world
    which God makes and rules, and which to the fairest mind is fairest, and to the
    holiest soul most sacred.</p>
    <p>Here and now, if ever anywhere at any time, there is need of men, there is appeal
    to what is godlike in man, calling upon us to rise above our prosperities, our
    politics, our mechanical aims and implements, and to turn the courage, energy, and
    practical sense which have wrought with miraculous power in developing the material
    resources of America, to the cultivation of our spiritual faculties. We alone of the
    great modern nations are without classical writers of our own, without a national
    literature. The thought and love of this people, its philosophy, poetry, and art lies
    yet in the bud; and our tens of thousands of books, even the better sort, must perish
    to enrich the soil that nourishes a life of heavenly promise. Hitherto we have been
    sad imitators of the English, but not the best the English have done will satisfy
    America. Their language indeed will remain ours, and their men of genius, above all
    their poets, will enrich our minds with great thoughts nobly expressed. But a
    literature is a national growth; it is the expression of a people's life and
    character, the more or less perfect utterance of what it loves,<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> aims at, believes
    in, hopes for; it has the qualities and the defects of the national spirit; it bears
    the marks of the thousand influences that help to make that spirit what it
    is,&mdash;and English literature cannot be American literature, for the simple reason
    that Americans are not Englishmen, any more than they are Germans or Frenchmen. We
    must be ourselves in our thinking and writing, as in our living, or be insignificant,
    for it is a man's life that gives meaning to his thought; and to write as a disciple
    is to write in an inferior way, since the mind at its best is illumined by truth
    itself and not taught by the words of another. It is not to be believed that this
    great, intelligent, yearning American world will content itself with the trick and
    mannerism of foreign accent and style, or that those who build on any other than the
    broad foundation of our own national life shall be accepted as teachers and guides.
    There is, of course, no method known to man by which a great author may be formed; no
    science which teaches how a literature may be created. The men who have written what
    the world will not permit to die have written generally without any clear knowledge
    of the worth of their work, just as great discoverers and inventors seem to stumble
    on what they seek; nevertheless one may hope by right endeavor to make himself
    capable of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
    uttering true thoughts so that they shall become intelligible and attractive to
    others; he may educate himself to know and love the best that has been spoken and
    written by men of genius, and so become a power to lift the aims and enlarge the
    views of his fellow-men. If many strive in this way to unfold their gifts and to
    cultivate their faculties, their influence will finally pervade the life and thought
    of thousands, and it may be of the whole people.</p>
    <p>I do not at all forget Aristotle's saying that "life is practice and not theory;"
    that men are born to do and suffer, and not to dream and weave systems; that conduct
    and not culture is the basis of character and the source of strength; that a
    knowledge of Nature is of vastly more importance to our material comfort and progress
    than philosophy, poetry, and art. This is not to be called in question; but in this
    country and age it seems hardly necessary that it be emphasized, for what is the
    whole world insisting upon but the necessity of scientific instruction, the
    importance of practical education, the cultivation of the money-getting faculty and
    habit, and the futility of philosophy, poetry, and art? Who is there that denies the
    worth of what is useful? Where is there one who does not approve and encourage
    whatever brings increase of wealth? Are we not all ready to<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> applaud projects which give promise of
    providing more abundant food, better clothing, and more healthful surrounding for the
    poor? Does not our national genius seem to lie altogether in the line of what is
    practically useful? Is it not our boast and our great achievement that we have in a
    single century made the wilderness of a vast continent habitable, have so ploughed
    and drained and planted and built that it can now easily maintain hundreds of
    millions in gluttonous plenty? Is not our whole social and political organization of
    a kind which fits us to deal with questions and affairs that concern our temporal and
    material welfare? What innumerable individuals among us are congressmen, legislators,
    supervisors, bank and school directors, presidents of boards and companies,
    committee-men, councilmen, heads of lodges and societies, lawyers, professors,
    teachers, editors, colonels, generals, judges, party-leaders, so that the sovereign
    people seems to have life and being only in its titled representatives! What does
    this universal reign of title and office mean but the practical education which
    responsibility gives? If from the midst of this paradise of utility, materialism, and
    business, a voice is raised to plead for culture, for intelligence, for beauty, for
    philosophy, poetry, and art, why need any one take alarm? While<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> human nature
    remains what it is, can there be danger that the many will be drawn away from what
    appeals to the senses, to what the soul loves and yearns for? If the Almighty God
    does not win the multitude to the love of righteousness and wisdom, how shall the
    words of man prevail?</p>
    <p>It is a mistake to oppose use to beauty, the serviceable to the excellent, since
    they belong together. Beauty is the blossom that makes the fruit-tree fair and
    fragrant. Life means more than meat and drink, house and clothing. To live is also to
    admire, to love, to lose one's self in the contemplation of the splendor with which
    Nature is clothed. Human life is the marriage of souls with things of light. Its
    basis, aim, and end is love, and love makes its object beautiful. Man may not even
    consent to eat, except with decency and grace; he must have light and flowers and the
    rippling music of kindly speech, that as far as possible he may forget that his act
    is merely animal and useful. He will lose sight of the fact that clothing is intended
    for protection and comfort, rather than not dress to make himself beautiful. To speak
    merely to be understood, and not to speak also with ease and elegance, is not to be a
    gentleman. How easily words find the way to the heart when uttered in melodious
    cadence by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> the
    lips of the fair and young. Home is the centre and seat of whatever is most useful to
    us; and yet to think of home is to think of spring-time and flowers, of the songs of
    birds and flowing waters, of the voices of children, of floating clouds and sunsets
    that linger as though heaven were loath to bid adieu to earth. The warmth, the color,
    and the light of their boyish days still glow in the hearts and imagination of noble
    men, and redeem the busy trafficking world of their daily life from utter vulgarity.
    What hues has not God painted on the air, the water, the fruit, and the grain that
    are the very substance and nutriment of our bodies? Beauty is nobly useful. It
    illumines the mind, raises the imagination, and warms the heart. It is not an added
    quality, but grows from the inner nature of things; it is the thought of God working
    outward. Only from drunken eyes can you with paint and tinsel hide inward deformity.
    The beauty of hills and waves, of flowers and clouds, of children at play, of reapers
    at work, of heroes in battle, of poets inspired, of saints rapt in
    adoration,&mdash;rises from central depths of being, and is concealed from frivolous
    minds. Even in the presence of death, the hallowing spirit of beauty is felt. The
    full-ripe fruit that gently falls in the quiet air of long summer days, the yellow
    sheaves glinting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
    67]</a></span> in the rays of autumn's sun, the leaf which the kiss of the hoar frost
    has made blood-red and loosened from the parent stem,&mdash;are images of death but
    they suggest only calm and pleasant thoughts. The Bedouin, who, sitting amid the
    ruins of Ephesus, thinks but of his goats and pigs, heedless of Diana's temple,
    Alexander's glory, and the words of Saint Paul, is the type of those who place the
    useful above the excellent and the fair; and as men who in their boards of trade buy
    and sell cattle and corn, dream not of green fields and of grain turning to gold in
    the sun of June, so we all, in the business and worry of life, lose sight of beauty
    which makes the heart glad and keeps it young.</p>
    <p>The mind of man is the earthly home of beauty, and if any real thing were fair as
    the tender thought of imaginative youth, heaven were not far. All we love is but our
    thought of what only thought makes known and makes beautiful, and for what we know
    love's thought may be the essence of all things.</p>

    <p>Nature is neither sad nor joyful. We but see in her the reflection of our own
    minds. Gay scenes depress the melancholy, and gloomy prospects have not the power to
    rob the happy of their contentment. The spring may fill us with fresh and fragrant
    thoughts, or may but remind us of all the hopes and joys we have lost; and autumn
    will speak to one of decay and death, to another of sleep and rest, after toil, to
    prepare for a new and brighter awakening. All the glory of dawn and sunset is but
    etheric waves thrilling the vapory air and impinging on the optic nerve; but behind
    it all is the magician who sees and knows, who thinks and loves. "It is the mind that
    makes the body rich." Thoughts take shape and coloring from souls through which they
    pass; and a free and open mind looks upon the world in the mood in which a fair woman
    beholds herself in a mirror. The world is his as much as the face is hers. If we
    could live in the fairest spot of earth, and in the company of those who are dear,
    the source of our happiness would still be our own thought and love; and if they are
    great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> and
    noble, we cannot be miserable however meanly surrounded. What is reality but a state
    of soul, finite in man, infinite in God? Theory underlies fact, and to the divine
    mind all things are godlike and beautiful. The chemical elements are as sweet and
    pure in the buried corpse as in the blooming body of youth; and it is defective
    intellect, the warp of ignorance and sin, which hides from human eyes the perfect
    beauty of the world.</p>

    <p>What we all need is not so much greater knowledge, as a luminous and symmetrical
    mind which, whatsoever way it turn, shall reflect the things that are, not in
    isolation and abstraction, but in the living unity and harmony wherein they have
    their being.</p>
    <p>The worth of religion is infinite, the value of conduct is paramount; but he who
    lacks intellectual culture, whatever else he may be, is narrow, awkward,
    unintelligent. The mirror of his soul is dim, the motions of his spirit are sluggish,
    and the divine image which is himself is blurred.</p>
    <p>But let no one imagine that this life of the soul in the mind is easy; for it is
    only less difficult than the life of the soul in God. To learn<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> many things; to
    master this or that science; to have skill in law or medicine; to acquaint one's self
    with the facts of history, with the opinions of philosophers or the teachings of
    theologians,&mdash;is comparatively not a difficult task; and there are hundreds who
    are learned, who are skillful, who are able, who have acuteness and depth and
    information, for one who has an open, free, and flexible mind,&mdash;which is alive
    and active in many directions, touching the world of God and Nature at many points,
    and beholding truth and beauty from many sides; which is serious, sober, and
    reasonable, but also fresh, gentle, and sympathetic; which enters with equal ease
    into the philosopher's thought, the poet's vision, and the ecstasy of the saint;
    which excludes no truth, is indifferent to no beauty, refuses homage to no goodness.
    The ideal of culture indeed, like that of religion, like that of art, lies beyond our
    reach, since the truth and beauty which lure us on, and flee the farther the longer
    we pursue, are nothing less than the eternal and infinite God.</p>
    <p>And culture, if it is not to end in mere frivolity and gloss, must be pursued,
    like religion and art, with earnestness and reverence. If the spirit in which we work
    is not deep and holy, we may become accomplished but we shall not gain wisdom, power,
    and love. The beginner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
    71]</a></span> seeks to convert his belief into knowledge; but the trained thinker
    knows that knowledge ends in belief, since beyond our little islets of intellectual
    vision, lies the boundless, fathomless expanse of unknown worlds where faith and hope
    alone can be our guides. Once individual man was insignificant; but now the earth
    itself is become so,&mdash;a mere dot in infinite space, where, for a moment, men
    wriggle like animalcules in a drop of water. And if at times a flash of light
    suddenly gleam athwart the mind, and it seem as though we were about to get a glimpse
    into the inner heart of being, the brightness quickly dies, and only the surfaces of
    things remain visible. Oh, the unimaginable length of ages when on the earth there
    was no living thing! then life's ugly, slimy beginnings; then the conscious soul's
    fitful dream stretching forth to endless time and space; then the final sleep in
    abysmal night with its one star of hope twinkling before the all-hidden throne of
    God, in the shadow of whose too great light faith kneels and waits!</p>
    <p>Why shall he whose mind is free, symmetrical, and open, be tempted to vain glory,
    to frivolous boasting? Shall not life be more solemn and sacred to him than to
    another? Shall he indulge scorn for any being whom God has made, for any thought
    which has strengthened and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg
    72]</a></span> consoled the human heart? Shall he not perceive, more clearly than
    others, that the unseen Power by whom all things are, is akin to thought and love,
    and that they alone bring help to man who make him feel that faith and hope mean
    good, and are fountains of larger and more enduring life? The highest mind, like the
    purest heart, is a witness of the soul and of God.</p>

    <p>The mass of mankind, if we pass the whole race in review, are sunk in gross
    ignorance; and even in civilized nations, where education is free, the multitude have
    but a rude acquaintance with the elements of knowledge. Their ability to read and
    write hardly serves intellectual and moral ends; and such learning as they possess
    seems only to weaken their power to admire and love what is best in life and
    thought.</p>
    <p>If we turn to the more cultivated, whose numbers even in the most enlightened
    countries are not great, we find but here and there an individual who has anything
    better than a sort of mechanical cleverness. Students, it has been said, on leaving
    college, quickly divide into two classes,&mdash;those who have learned nothing, and
    those who have forgotten everything. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74"
    id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> professions, the lawyer tends to become an advocate,
    the physician an empiric, the theologian a dogmatist; and these are but instances of
    a general falling away from ideals. The student of physical science is subdued to
    what he works in; the man of letters loses depth and earnestness; and the teacher,
    whose business it is to rouse and illumine souls, shrivels until he becomes merely a
    repeater of facts and doctrines in which there is no life, no power to exalt the
    imagination or to give tone to the intellect. The teacher cannot create talent, and
    his best work lies in stimulating and directing energy and impulse; but this he
    seldom strives to do or to make himself capable of doing; and hence pupils very
    generally leave school as men quit a prison, with a sense of emancipation, and with a
    desire to forget both the place and the kind of life there encouraged. A talent is
    like seed-corn,&mdash;it bears within itself the power to break the confining walls
    and to spring upward to light, if only it be sown in proper soil, where the rain and
    the sunshine fall; but this is a truth which those who make education a business are
    slow to accept. They repress; they overawe; they are dictatorial; they prescribe
    rules and methods for minds which can gain strength and wisdom only by following the
    bent given by their endowments,&mdash;and thus the young,<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> who are most easily discouraged in
    things which concern their highest gifts, lose heart, turn away from ideals, and
    abandon the pursuit of excellence. The nobler the mind, the greater the danger of its
    being wrongly dealt with. We seldom find a man whose thinking has helped to form
    opinion and to create literature, who, if he care to say what he feels, will not
    declare that his scholastic training was bad. Milton, Gray, Dryden, Wordsworth,
    Byron, Cowley, Addison, Gibbon, Locke, Shelley, and Cowper had no love for the
    schools to which they were sent; Swift and Goldsmith received no college honors; and
    Pope, Thomson, Burns, and Shakespeare had little or nothing to do with institutions
    of learning. A man educates himself; and the best work teachers can do, is to inspire
    the love of mental exercise and a living faith in the power of labor to develop
    faculty, and to open worlds of use and delight which are infinite, and which each
    individual must rediscover for himself. It is the educator's business to cherish the
    aspirations of the young, to inspire them with confidence in themselves, and to make
    them feel and understand that no labor can be too great or too long, if its result be
    cultivation and enlightenment of mind. For them ideals are real; their life is as yet
    wrapped in the bud; and to encourage them to believe that if<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> they are but true to themselves, the
    flower and the fruit will be fair and health-bringing, is to open for them the
    fountain of hope and noble endeavor.</p>
    <p>What men have done, men can still do. Nay, shall we not rather believe that the
    best is yet to be done? The peoples whom we call ancient were but rude beginners. We
    are the true ancients, the inheritors of all the wisdom and all the heroism of the
    past. We stand in a wider world, and move forward with more conscious purpose along
    more open ways. Of the past we see but the summits, illumined by the rays of genius
    and glory. Could we look upon the plains where the multitudes lie in darkness,
    wearing the triple chain of servitude, ignorance, and want, we should understand how
    fair and beneficent our own age is. Enthusiasm for the past cannot inspire the best
    intellectual work. The heart turns to the past; but the mind looks to the future, and
    is forever untwisting the cords which bind us to the things that pleased a childlike
    fancy. To grow is to outgrow; and whatever of the past survives, survives, as the
    very word implies, because it is still living and applicable here and now. Let not
    the young believe that the age of the heroic and godlike is gone. Good and the means
    of good are not harder to reconcile to-day than they were a<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> hundred or a thousand years ago, and
    they who have a heart may now, as the best have done in the past, wring even from
    despair the courage on which victory loves to smile. If we are weak and inferior the
    fault lies in ourselves, not in the age. We are the age; and if we but will and work,
    opportunities are offered us to become and to perform whatever may crown and glorify
    a human soul. The time for doing best things, like eternity, is ever present. Let but
    the man stand forth, and he will find and do his work.</p>
    <p>We are too near our own age to discern its true glory, which shall best appear
    from the vantage-ground of another century; but surely we can feel that it throbs
    with life, with immortal yearnings, with ever-growing desire to give to all men
    higher thoughts and purer loves. Society, the State, the Church, the individual, are
    striving with conscious purpose to make life moral and intelligent. We have become
    more humane than men have ever been, and accept more fully the duty and the task of
    extending the domain of justice, of goodness, and of truth. The aim of our
    civilization is not merely to instruct the ignorant, but to make ignorance
    impossible; not merely to feed the hungry, but to do away with famine; not merely to
    visit the captive, but to make captivity the means of his<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> regeneration. Already the chains of
    the slave have been broken, and the earth has become the home of God's free children.
    Disease has been tracked to its secret hiding-places, and barriers have been built
    against pestilence and contagion. War has become less frequent and less barbarous;
    persecution for opinion and belief has become rare; man's inhumanity to woman, which
    is the deepest stain upon the history of the race, has yielded to the influence of
    religion and knowledge; and with ever-increasing force the truth is borne in upon
    those who think and observe, that the fate of the rich and high-placed cannot be
    separated from that of the poor and lowly. While we earnestly strive to control and
    repress every kind of moral evil, we feel that society itself is responsible for sin
    and crime, and that social and political conditions and constitutions must change,
    until the weak and the heavy-laden are protected from the heartlessness of the strong
    and fortunate. Not only must those who labor with their hands have larger
    opportunities than hitherto have ever been given them, but in the whole social life
    of man there must be more justice, more love, more tenderness, more of the spirit of
    Christ, than hitherto has ever been found there.</p>
    <p>What marvelous, intellectual work are we not doing? What admirable expression of
    the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> highest
    truth do we not find in the best writers of our age! It is not all pure gold; but
    whether we take a religious, a moral, or an intellectual point of view, we may not
    affirm of the literature of any age or country that it is perfect. When man clothes
    in words what he thinks and loves, what he knows and believes, his work bears the
    marks of his defects not less than those of his qualities. Nay, if we turn to the
    Bible itself, how much do we not find there which we either fail to comprehend or are
    unable to apply! Has not the mind of Christendom been trained and illumined by the
    literatures of Greece and Rome, which in moral purity, in elevation of sentiment, in
    breadth and depth of thought, in the knowledge of the laws of Nature, in scientific
    accuracy, in sympathy and tenderness, are altogether inferior to the best writings of
    our own day? It is a mistake to suppose that this is a material age in which the love
    of religion, of poetry, of art, of excellence of whatever kind, is dead. The love of
    what is best has never at any time been alive save in the hearts of the chosen few;
    and in such souls it burns now with as sweet and steady a glow as when Plato spoke,
    and the blessed Saviour uttered words of divine wisdom. Here and now, in and around
    us, there is the heavenly presence of budding life, of widening vision, of<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> "new thoughts
    urgent as the growth of wings." Let us turn the white forehead of hope to the fair
    time, and deem no labor great by which we shall become less unfit to do the work of
    God and man.</p>

    <p>But to enter upon such a course of life with well-founded hope of success, we must
    be reverent and devout. The thrill of awe is, as Goethe says, the best thing humanity
    has. We must understand and feel that the visible is but the shadow of the invisible,
    that the soul has its roots in God, whose kingdom is within us. We must perceive that
    what we know, believe, admire, love, and yearn for makes our real life; that we are
    worth what we <i>are</i>, and not what we possess and use. We must be lovers of
    perfection, as the divine Saviour bids us become,&mdash;"Be ye perfect, even as your
    Father in heaven is perfect." We must be conscious of the immortal spirit which is
    ourself, and walk in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg
    81]</a></span> company of God and of just men made perfect, striving after light and
    purity and strength, which are of the soul. We must love the inward, the true, and
    the eternal rather than the outward and transitory. We must believe that in very
    truth we are akin to God, that God is in us, and we in him, and consequently that it
    is our first duty to follow after perfection, completeness of life, in thought, in
    love, and in conduct. As it is good to know, so is it good to be strong, to be
    patient, to be humble, to be helpful; so is it good to do right, though the deed
    should be our only reward.</p>
    <p>But we are beset by all manner of temptations to turn aside from a high and noble
    way of living. The line of least resistance for us is the common highway of
    money-getters and place-winners; and the moment a man gives evidence of ability, the
    whole world urges him to put it to immediate use. Our public opinion identifies the
    good with the useful, all else is visionary and unreal. The average man controls us
    not only in politics, but in religion, in art, and in literature. To turn away from
    material good in order to gain spiritual and intellectual benefit is held to be
    evidence of a feeble or perverted understanding. If a man is eloquent, let him become
    a lawyer, a politician, or a preacher; if he have a talent for science, let<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> him become a
    physician, a practical chemist, or a civil engineer; if he have skill in writing, let
    him become a journalist or a contributor to magazines. No one asks himself, What
    shall I do to gain wisdom, strength, virtue, completeness of life; but the universal
    question is, How shall I make a living, get money, position, notoriety? In our hearts
    we should rather have the riches of a Rothschild than the mind of Plato, the
    imagination of Shakespeare, or the soul of Saint Theresa. We believe the best is
    outside of us, that the aids to the most desirable kind of life are to be found in
    material and mechanical things. We talk with pride of our numbers, our institutions,
    our machines; we love the display and noise of life, are eager to mingle in crowds,
    to live in great cities, and to listen to exaggerated and declamatory speech. The
    soberness of wisdom, the humility of religion, the plainness of worth, are
    unattractive and unrecognized. We rush after material things, like hunters after
    game; and in the excitement of the chase our pulse grows quick, and our vision
    confused. We have lost the art of patient work and expectation. We are no more
    capable of living in our work, of making it the means of our growth and happiness.
    What we do, must be quickly done, must have immediate results. Our success in solving
    the political and social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg
    83]</a></span> problems has spoiled us. When we hear of a man who has been prosperous
    for years, whom no misfortune has sobered and softened, we expect him to be narrow
    and supercilious; and in the same way, a prosperous people are exposed to the danger
    of becoming self-complacent and superficial. We exaggerate the importance of our own
    achievements and think that which we have accomplished is the best; whereas the wise
    hold what they have done in slight esteem, and think only of becoming themselves
    nobler and wiser. Instead of boasting of our civilization, because we have industrial
    and commercial prosperity, wealth and liberty, churches, schools, and newspapers, we
    ought to ask ourselves whether civilization does not imply something more and higher
    than this,&mdash;what kind of soul lives and loves and thinks in this environment?
    Instead of trying to persuade ourselves that we are the greatest and most enlightened
    people, would it not be worth while to ask ourselves, in a dispassionate temper,
    whether our best men and women are the most intellectual, the most interesting, and
    the most Christian men and women to be found in the world? Do they not lack repose,
    distinction, a sense for complete and harmonious living? Must we not still look to
    Europe for our best religious and philosophic thought, our best<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> poetry, painting,
    music, and architecture? "Let the passion for America," says Emerson, "cast out the
    passion for Europe." This is desirable, but numbers and wealth will not bring it
    about. While the best is said and done in Europe, the better sort of Americans will
    look thither,&mdash;just as Europe looks to us for corn and cotton, or mechanical
    appliances. We have done much, and much that it was well to do. We have, as Matthew
    Arnold says, solved the political and social problems better than any other people,
    though we ourselves perceive that the solution is by no means final. The conditions
    of our life are favorable to the many. It is easier for a man to assert himself here,
    than it is or has ever been elsewhere. A little sense, a little energy, is all that
    any one needs to make himself independent and comfortable; and because success of
    this kind is so easy it threatens to absorb our whole life. They alone seem to be
    living worthily who are doing practical work, who are developing the natural wealth
    of the country, starting new enterprises and inventing new machines. The political
    problems which interest us are financial; schools are maintained and fostered because
    they protect and strengthen our institutions; religious beliefs are tolerated and
    encouraged because they are aids to morality,&mdash;and morality means sobriety,
    honesty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
    industry, which lead to thrift. Then there is an idea that religion is a conservative
    power, useful as a bulwark against the assaults of anti-social fanatics. Philosophy,
    poetry, and art are not considered seriously, because they are not seen to bear any
    clear relation to our institutions and temporal well-being. Opinion rules the wide
    world over; and in the face of this strong public opinion which lays stress chiefly
    upon external things,&mdash;the environment, the machinery of life,&mdash;and not
    upon spiritual and intellectual qualities, it is not easy to love knowledge and
    virtue for themselves, for the strength and beauty they give to the soul, for their
    power to build up the being which is a man's very self. It is rare that men have
    faith in what but few believe in; they are gregarious, and need the encouragement
    that comes of having aims and hopes of which the millions approve.</p>
    <p>The predominance of the average man, of which our public opinion is the result,
    puts other obstacles in the way of culture. It makes us self-complacent, easily
    satisfied with what we perform. A representative man will become a lawyer, a soldier,
    a merchant, a legislator, an author, in turns, as occasion offers, and he has no
    doubt of his sufficiency; because average work is all that is expected of any one. To
    be able to do anything fairly well seems to us a<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> more desirable accomplishment than to
    be able to do some one thing better than anybody else. But this is a view which only
    those may take who live in an imperfectly developed society. As men become more
    cultivated, they more and more want only the best; and the noblest natures feel the
    desire to do their best, not with their actual power, but with the skill which forty
    or fifty years of discipline and effort might give them. They are laborious; they are
    patient; they persevere in one direction; they believe that if they but continue to
    observe, to think, to read, to compare, and to express in plain words what they know,
    their power of seeing and of uttering will continue to grow. The charm of increasing
    faculty in an infinite world sways and controls them. They never know enough; they
    are never able to say well enough what they know; and so they grow old still learning
    many things. They work in a spirit wholly different from that of the common man, who
    if he get through with what he has in hand is satisfied. They have an artist's sense
    of perfection; and like Virgil would burn the works which if they once escape their
    own hands, the world will never permit to perish.</p>
    <p>It is hard to resist when many invite to utterance; and with us whoever has
    ability is urged to put himself forward, and consequently to<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> dissipate in crude performances
    energies which if employed in self-culture might make of him a philosopher, a poet,
    or a man of science. As it is easier to act than to think, the multitude of course
    will be only talkers, writers, and performers; but a great and civilized people must
    have at least a few men who take rank with the profound thinkers and finished
    scholars of the world. No lover of America can help thinking it undesirable that any
    one should be able to say of us with truth, what Locke has said, "The Americans are
    not all born with worse understandings than the Europeans, though we see none of them
    have such reaches in the arts and sciences." It is our aim to create the highest
    civilization; but the highest civilization is favorable to the highest life, which
    implies and requires more than the possession of material things. Conduct is
    necessary, knowledge is necessary, beauty is necessary, manners are necessary, and a
    civilized people must develop life in all these directions, and as far as such a
    thing is possible, harmoniously. Whoever excels in conduct, or in knowledge, or in a
    sense for the beautiful, or in manners, helps to raise the standard of
    living,&mdash;helps to give worth, dignity, charm, and refinement to life. It is hard
    to take interest in a people who have no profound thinkers, no great artists, no
    accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>plished
    scholars, for only such men can lift a people above the provincial spirit, and bring
    them into conscious relationship with former ages and the wide world. The rule of the
    people looks to something higher than opportunity for every man to have food and a
    home; to something more than putting a church, a school, and a newspaper at every
    man's door. Saints and heroes, philosophers and poets, are a people's glory. They
    give us nobler loves, higher thoughts, diviner aims. They show us how like a god man
    may become; and political and social institutions which make saints and heroes,
    philosophers and poets, impossible, can have but inferior value. And there is some
    radical wrong where the noblest manhood and womanhood are not appreciated and
    reverenced. Not to recognize genuine worth is the mark of a superficial and vulgar
    character. The servile spirit has no conception of the heroic nature; and they who
    measure life by material standards, do not perceive the infinite which is in man and
    which makes him godlike. A few only in any age or nation love the best, follow after
    ideal aims; but when these few are wanting, all life becomes common-place, and the
    millions pass from the cradle to the grave and leave no lasting impression upon the
    world.</p>
    <p>The practical turn of mind which finds ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89"
    id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>pression in our commercial and industrial
    achievements, makes itself felt also in our intellectual activity, and those among us
    who have knowledge and power of utterance are expected, almost required, to throw
    themselves into the breakers of controversy, to discuss the hundred political,
    social, religious, financial, sanitary, and educational problems which are ever
    waiting to be solved. Let them enter the lists, let them take sides, let them strive
    to see clear in an atmosphere of smoke and fog; and not to do this is, in the
    estimation of the many, to be a dreamer, a dilettante, a thinker to no purpose. But
    this is precisely what those who seek to cultivate themselves, who seek to learn and
    communicate the best that is known, ought not to do. They should live in a serene
    air, in a world of tranquility and peace, where the soul is not troubled by
    contention, where the view is not perturbed by passion. They should have leisure,
    which is the original meaning of school and scholar; for the mind, like the soul, is
    refreshed and strengthened by quiet meditation. Its improvement is slow, is
    imperceptible often; its training is the result of delicate methods which require
    patience and perseverance, faith in ideals, and a constant looking to the all-perfect
    Infinite; and to throw it into the noise and confusion of the busy excited world
    of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> practical
    affairs is to stunt and warp its growth. We do not hitch a race-horse to the plough,
    nor should we ask the best intellects to do the common work of which every man is
    capable. They render the best service, when living in communion with the highest and
    most cultivated minds of the past and present, they learn and teach the way of
    looking and thinking, of behaving and doing, which has been followed by the greatest
    and noblest of the race. Political and social questions are forever changing; views
    which commend themselves to-day will in a few years seem absurd; measures which are
    thought to be of vital importance will grow to be inapplicable. To talk and write
    about such things is well,&mdash;may help to prevent stagnation and corruption in
    public life; but they exercise altogether a higher office, who live in the presence
    of what is permanently true and good and beautiful, who believe in ideal aims and
    ends and prevent the masses from losing sight of what constitutes man's real worth.
    They do what they alone can do, whereas the practical and the useful may be any one's
    work. They may not, of course, isolate themselves; on the contrary they must live
    closer than other men not only to God and Nature, but also to the past and present
    history of their country and of mankind. They study the movements of the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> age, but they study
    them in a philosophic and not in a partisan spirit. They seek to know, not what is
    popular, but what is right and good; and they often see clearly where the view of
    others is uncertain and confused. Encouragements and rewards are not necessary for
    them, for they are drawn to the knowledge and love of the best by irresistible
    attractions, and the more they learn and love the more beneficent and joy-giving does
    their life become. Their aims and ends are in harmony with the highest reason and the
    highest faith. The world they live in abides; and if they are neglected or forgotten
    now, they can wait, for truth and goodness and beauty can never lose their power or
    their charm.</p>

    <p>The passion for truth and for the culture which makes its possession possible is
    not rightly felt by the heart of boy or of youth; it is the man's passion, and its
    power over him is most irresistibly asserted when outward restraint has been removed,
    when escaping from the control of parents and teachers he is left to himself to shape
    his course and seek his own ends. When his companions have finished their studies he
    feels that his own are now properly only about to begin; when they are dreaming of
    liberty and pleasure, of wealth and success, of the world and its honors, his mind is
    haunted by the mystery of God and Nature, by visions of dimly discerned truth and
    beauty which he must follow whithersoever they lead; and already he perceives that
    wisdom comes to those alone who toil and cease not from labor, who suffer and are
    patient. Hitherto he has learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93"
    id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> the lessons given him by teachers appointed by
    others; henceforth he is himself to choose his instructors. As once,
    half-unconscious, he played in the smile or frown of Nature, and drank knowledge with
    delight, so now in the world of man's thought, hope, and love, he is, with deliberate
    purpose, to seek what is good for the nourishment of his soul. Happy is he, for
    nearly all men toil and suffer that they may live; but he is also to have time to
    labor, to make life intelligent and fair. He must know not only what the blind atoms
    are doing, but what saints, sages, and heroes have loved, thought, and done. He will
    still keep close to Nature who, though she utters myriad sounds, never speaks a human
    word; but he will also lend his ear to the voice of wisdom which lies asleep in
    books, and to sympathetic minds whispers from other worlds whatever high or holy
    truth has consecrated the life of man. His guiding thought must be how to make the
    work by which he maintains himself in the world subserve moral and intellectual ends;
    for his aim is not merely or chiefly to have goods, but to be wise and good, and
    therefore to build up within himself the power of conduct and the power of
    intelligence which makes man human, and distinguishes him from whatever else on earth
    has life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
    <p>It is our indolence and frivolity that make routine duties, however distracting or
    importunate, incompatible with the serious application which the work of self-culture
    demands; but we are by nature indolent and frivolous, and only education can make us
    earnest and laborious. None but a cultivated mind can understand that if the whole
    human race could be turned loose, to eat and drink and play like thoughtless
    children, life would become meaningless; that a paradise in which work should not be
    necessary would become wearisome. The progress of the race is the result of effort,
    physical, religious, moral, and intellectual; and the advance of individuals is
    proportional to their exertion. Nature herself pushes the young to bodily exercise;
    but though activity is for them a kind of necessity, only the discipline of habit
    will lead them to prefer labor to idleness; and they will not even use their senses
    properly unless they are taught to look and to listen,&mdash;just as they are taught
    to walk and to ride. The habit of manual labor, as it is directly related to the
    animal existence to which man is prone, and supplies the physical wants whose urgency
    is most keenly felt, is acquired with least difficulty, and it prepares the way for
    moral and intellectual life; but it especially favors the life which has regard to
    temporal ends and conduces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg
    95]</a></span> to comfort and well-being. They whose instrument is the brain rarely
    aim at anything higher than wealth and position; and if they become rich and
    prominent, they remain narrow and uninteresting. They talk of progress, of new
    inventions and discoveries, and they neglect to improve themselves; they boast of the
    greatness of their country, while their real world is one of vulgar thought and
    desire; they take interest in what seems to concern the general welfare, but fail to
    make themselves centres of light and love. What is worse they have the conceit of
    wisdom,&mdash;they lack reverence; they are impatient, and must have at once what
    they seek. But the better among us see the insufficiency of the popular aims, and
    begin to yearn for something other than a life of politics, newspapers, and financial
    enterprise. They desire to know and love the best that is known, and they are willing
    to be poor and obscure, if they may but gain entrance into this higher world. "I
    shall ever consider myself," says Descartes, "more obliged to those who leave me to
    my leisure, than I should to any who might offer me the most honorable employments."
    This is the thought of every true student and lover of wisdom; for he feels that
    whatever a man's occupation may be, his business is to improve his mind and to form
    his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> character.
    He desires not to be known and appreciated, but to know and appreciate; not to
    <i>have</i> more, but to <i>be</i> more; not to have friends, but to be the friend of
    man,&mdash;which he is when he is the lover of truth. He turns from vulgar pleasures
    as he turns from pain, because both pleasure and pain in fastening the soul to the
    body deprive it of freedom and hinder the play of the mind.</p>

    <p>Unless one have deep faith in the good of culture he will easily become
    discouraged in the work which is here urged upon him. He must be drawn to the love of
    intellectual excellence by an attraction such as a poet feels in the presence of
    beauty; he must believe in it as a miser believes in gold; he must seek it as a lover
    seeks the beloved. Our wants determine our pleasures, and they who have no
    intellectual cravings feel not the need of exercise of mind. They are born and remain
    inferior. They are content with the world which seems to be real, forgetting the
    higher one, which alone is real; they are not urged to the intellectual life by
    irresistible instincts. They are discouraged by difficulties, thwarted by obstacles
    which lie in the path of all who strive to move forward and to gain higher planes. It
    is not possible to ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
    97]</a></span>vance except along the road of toil, of struggle, and of suffering. We
    cannot emerge even from childish ignorance and weakness without experiencing a sense
    of loss. Mental work in the beginning and for a long time is weariness, is little
    better than drudgery. We labor, and there seems to be no gain; we study and there
    seems to be no increase of knowledge or power; and if we persevere, we are led by
    faith and hope, not by any clear perception of the result of persistent application.
    Genius itself is not exempt from this law. Poets and artists work with an intensity
    unknown to others, and are distinguished by their faith in the power of labor. The
    consummate musician must practice for hours, day by day, year in and year out. The
    brain is the most delicate and the finest of instruments, and it is vain to imagine
    that anything else than ceaseless, patient effort will enable us to use it with
    perfect skill; indeed, it is only after long study that we become capable of
    understanding what the perfection of the intellect is, that we become capable of
    discerning what is excellent, beautiful, and true in style and thought.</p>
    <p>Discouragement and weariness will, again and again, suggest doubts concerning the
    wisdom of this ceaseless effort to improve one's self. Why persist in the pursuit of
    what can never be com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
    98]</a></span>pletely attained? Why toil to gain what the mass of men neither admire
    nor love? Why wear out life in a course of action which leads neither to wealth nor
    honors? Why turn away from pleasures which lie near us to follow after ideal things?
    These are questions which force themselves upon us; and it requires faith and courage
    not to be shaken by this sophistry. Visions of ideal life float before young eyes,
    and if to be attracted by what is high and fair were enough, it were not difficult to
    be saint, sage, or hero; but when we perceive that the way to the best is the road of
    toil and drudgery, that we must labor long and accomplish little, wander far and
    doubt our progress, must suffer much and feel misgivings whether it is not in
    vain,&mdash;then only the noblest and the bravest still push forward in obedience to
    inward law. The ideal of culture appeals to them with irresistible force. They
    consent to lack wealth, and the approval of friends and the world's applause; they
    are willing to turn away when fair hands hold out the cup of pleasure, when bright
    eyes and smiling lips woo to indulgence. If, you ask, How long? They answer, Until we
    die! They are lovers of wisdom and do not trust to hope of temporal reward. Their aim
    is light and purity of mind and heart; these they would not barter for comfort and
    position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> As
    saints, while doing the common work of men, walk uplifted to worlds invisible, so
    they, amid the noise and distractions of life still hear the appealing voice of
    truth; and as parted lovers dream only of the hour when they shall meet again, so
    these chosen spirits, in the midst of whatever cares and labors, turn to the time
    when thought shall people their solitude as with the presence of angels. They hear
    heavenly voices asking, Why stay ye on the earth, unless to grow? Vanity, frivolity,
    and fickleness die within them; and they grow to be humble and courageous,
    disinterested and laborious, strong and persevering. The cultivation of their higher
    nature becomes the law of their life; and the sense of duty, "stern daughter of the
    voice of God," which of all motives that sway the heart, best stands the test of
    reason, becomes their guide and support. Thus culture, which looks to the Infinite
    and All-wise as to its ideal, rests upon the basis of morality and religion.</p>
    <p>To think is difficult, and they who wish to grow in power of thought must hoard
    their strength. Excess, of whatever kind, is a waste of intellectual force. The
    weakness of men of genius has impoverished the world. Sensual indulgence diminishes
    spiritual insight; it perverts reason, and deadens love; it enfeebles the physical
    man, and weakens the organs of sense,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100"
    id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> which are the avenues of the soul. The higher self
    is developed harmoniously only when it springs from a healthful body. It is the lack
    of moral balance which makes genius akin to madness. Nothing is so sane as reason,
    and great minds fall from truth only when they fail in the strength which comes of
    righteous conduct.</p>
    <p>Let the lover of wisdom then strive to live in a healthy body that his senses may
    report truly of the universe in which he dwells. But this is not easy; for mental
    labor exhausts, and if the vital forces are still further diminished by dissipation,
    disease and premature decay of the intellectual faculties will be the result. The
    ideal of culture embraces the whole man, physical, moral, religious, and
    intellectual; and the loss of health or morality or faith cannot but impede the
    harmonious development of the mind itself. Passion is the foe of reason, and may
    easily become strong enough to extinguish its light. He who wishes to educate himself
    must learn to resist the desires of his lower nature, which if indulged deaden
    sensibility, weaken the will, take from the imagination its freshness, and from the
    heart the power of loving. The task he has set himself is arduous, and he cannot have
    too much energy, too much warmth of soul, too much capacity for labor. Let him not
    waste, like a mere animal, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101"
    id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> strength which was given him that he might learn to
    know and love infinite truth and beauty. The dwelling with one's self and with
    thoughts of what is true and high, which is an essential condition of mental growth,
    is impossible when the sanctuary of the soul is filled with unclean images.
    Intellectual honesty, the disinterested love of truth, without which no progress can
    be made, will hardly be found in those who are the slaves of unworthy passions. The
    more religious a man is, the more does he believe in the worth and sacredness of
    truth, and the more willing does he become to throw all his energies with persevering
    diligence into the work of self-improvement. They who fail to see in the universe an
    all-wise, all-holy, and all-powerful Being, from whom are all things and to whom all
    things turn, easily come to doubt whether it holds anything of true worth. History
    teaches this, and it requires little reflection to perceive that it must be so. Of
    the Solitary, Wordsworth says,&mdash;</p>

    <p>The corrupt and the ignorant easily learn to feel contempt, but the scholar is
    reverent. He moves in the midst of infinite worlds, and knows that the least is part
    of the whole.</p>
    <p>Now, how shall he who is resolved to educate himself set about his work? What
    advice shall be given him? What rules shall be made for him that he may not waste
    time and energy? He who yearns for the cultivation of mind which makes wisdom
    possible must work his way to the light. All intellectual men strive to educate
    themselves, but each one strives in a different way. They all aim at insight rather
    than information, at the perfect use of their faculties rather than learning. The
    power to see things as they are, is what they want; and therefore they look, observe,
    examine, compare, analyze, meditate, read, and write. And they keep doing this day by
    day; and the longer they work, the more attractive their work grows to be. Descartes,
    who is a typical lover of the intellectual life, looked upon himself simply as a
    thinking being, and gave all his thought to the cultivation of his higher faculties
    in the hope that he might finally discover some truth which would bring blessings to
    men. He had no thought of literary fame, published little, and sedulously avoided
    whatever might bring him into notoriety. "Those," he says, "who<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> wish to know how
    to speak of everything and to acquire a reputation for learning, will succeed most
    easily if they content themselves with the semblance of truth, which may readily be
    found." The love of truth is the mark of the real student. What is, is; it is man's
    business to know it. He is the foe of pretense; sham for him means shame. He will
    have sound knowledge; he will do his work well; whether men shall applaud or reward
    him for it, is a foreign consideration. He obeys an inward law, and the praise of
    those who cannot understand him sounds to him like mockery. True thought, like right
    conduct, is its own reward. To see truth and to love it is enough,&mdash;is more than
    to have the worship of the world. The important thing is to be a man, to have a
    serious purpose, to be in earnest, to yearn for what is good and holy; and without
    this the culture of the intellect will not avail.</p>
    <p>We must build upon the broad foundation of man's life, and not upon any special
    faculty. The merely literary man is often the most pitiful of men,&mdash;able, it may
    be, to do little else than complain that his merits are not recognized. Let it not be
    imagined then that the lover of wisdom, the follower of intellectual good, should
    propose to himself a literary career. He may of course be or become a man<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> of letters, but
    this is incidental to his life-purpose, which is to develop within himself the power
    of knowing and loving. He will learn to think rightly and to act well, first of all;
    for he knows that a man's writing cannot be worth more than he himself is worth. He
    is a seeker after truth and perfection; and understanding at the price of what
    countless labors these may be hoped for, he is slow to imagine that words of his may
    be of help to others.</p>
    <p>Observation, reading, and writing are the chief means by which thought is
    stimulated, the mind developed, and the intellect cultivated. The habit of looking
    and the habit of thinking are closely related. A man thinks as he sees; and for a
    mind like Shakespeare's, for instance, observation is almost the only thing that is
    necessary for its development. The boundless world breaks in upon him with creative
    force. His sympathy is universal, and therefore so is his interest. He sees the like
    in the unlike, the differences in things which are similar. Every little bird and
    every little flower are known to him. He contemplates Falstaff and Poor Tom with as
    much interest as though they were Hamlet and King Lear. In all original minds the
    power of observation is great. It is the chief source of our earliest knowledge, of
    that which touches us most nearly and most deeply<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> colors the imagination. When the
    boy is wandering through fields, sitting in the shade of trees, or lying on the banks
    of murmuring streams, he is not only learning more delightful things than books will
    ever teach him, but he is also acquiring the habit of attention, of looking at what
    he sees, which nowhere else can be gotten in so natural and pleasant a way. Hence the
    best minds have either been born in the country or have passed there some of their
    early years. Unless we have first learned to look with the eye, we shall never learn
    to look with the mind. They who walk unmoved beneath the starlit heavens, or by the
    ever-moving ocean, or amid the silent mountains; who do not find, like Wordsworth,
    that the meanest flower that blows gives thoughts which often lie too deep for tears,
    will not derive great help from the world of books. But in the world of books the
    intellectual must also make themselves at home and live, must thence draw
    nourishment, light, wisdom, strength, for there as nowhere else the mind of man has
    stamped its image; and there the thoughts of the master spirits still breathe, still
    glow with truth and beauty. The best books are powers</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">"Forever to be hallowed; only less,<br />
        </span> <span class="i0">For what we are and what we may become,<br />

    <p>But it is as difficult to know books as to know men. There are but few men who can
    be of intellectual service to us; and there are but few books which stimulate and
    nourish the mind. The best books are, as Milton says, "the precious life-blood of a
    master spirit;" and it is absurd to suppose that they will reveal their secret to
    every chance comer, to every heedless reader. As it takes a hero to know a hero, so
    only an awakened mind can love and understand the great thinkers. The reading of the
    ignorant is chiefly a mechanical proceeding; and, indeed, for men in general reading
    is little better than waste of time. Their reading, like their conversation, leaves
    them what they were, or worse. The mass of printed matter has no greater value from
    an intellectual point of view at least than the wide ever-flowing stream of talk; and
    for the multitude it is all the same whether they gossip and complain, or read and
    nod. However much they read, they remain unintelligent; what knowledge they gain is
    fragmentary, unreal; they learn merely enough to talk about what they do not
    understand. We may of course read for entertainment, as we may talk for
    entertainment; but this is merely a recreation of the mind, which is good only
    because it rests and prepares us for work. The wise read books to be enlightened,
    uplifted, and inspired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
    107]</a></span> Their reading is a labor in which every faculty of the mind is awake
    and active. They are attentive; they weigh, compare, judge. They re-create within
    their own minds the images produced by the author; they seek to enter into his inmost
    thought; they admire each well-turned phrase, each happy epithet; they walk with him,
    and make themselves at home in the wonderland which his genius has called into being;
    past centuries rise before them, and they almost forget that they did not hear Plato
    discourse in the Academy, or stroll with Horace along the Sacred Way. As they are
    brought thus intimately into the company of the noblest minds, they think as they
    thought, feel as they felt, and so are enlightened and inspired. They drink the
    spirit of the mighty dead, and gradually come to live in a higher and richer world.
    The best in life and literature is seen to be such only by those who have made
    themselves worthy of the heavenly vision; and once we have learned to love the few
    real books of the world, or rather what in these few is eternally true and beautiful,
    we breathe the atmosphere of the intellectual life. What is frivolous, or false, or
    vulgar can no longer please us; having seen and loved what is high we may not sink to
    the lower.</p>
    <p>Knowledge may be useful, and yet have little<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> power to nourish, train, and
    enlarge the mind, and it is its disciplinary and educational value which we are here
    considering. Medicine for a physician, law for an attorney, theology for a clergyman,
    is the most useful knowledge; but they are not therefore the best means of
    intellectual culture. Natural science, though it is most useful, ministering as it
    does in a thousand ways and with ever-increasing efficacy to our wants and comforts,
    has but an inferior educational power. Acquaintance with the uniform co-existences
    and sequences of phenomena is not a mental tonic. Such knowledge not only leaves us
    unmoved,&mdash;it has a tendency even to fetter the free play of the mind and to
    chill the imagination. It unweaves the rainbow, and leaves us the dead chemical
    elements. The information we have gained is practical, but it does not exalt the soul
    or render us more keenly alive to the divine beauty which rests on Nature's face. It
    does not enable us, as does the knowledge of literature and history, to participate
    in the conscious life of the race. It makes no appeal to our nobler human instincts.
    There is no book on natural science, nor can there ever be one, which may take a
    place among the few immortal works which men never cease to read and love. Physical
    science has its own domain, and its study will continue to enrich the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> world, to make
    specialists of a hundred kinds; but it never can take the place of literature and
    history as a means of culture; and as an educational force its value is greatest when
    it is studied not experimentally, but as literature,&mdash;though of course, every
    cultivated man should be familiar with the inductive method, and should receive
    consequently a certain scientific training.</p>
    <p>History, in bringing us into the presence of the greatest men and in showing us
    their mightiest achievements, rouses our whole being. It sets the mind aglow, awakens
    enthusiasm, and fires the imagination. It makes us feel how blessed a thing it is "to
    scorn delights and live laborious days;" how divine to perish in bringing truth and
    holiness to men. We commingle with the makers of the world; we hear them speak and
    see them act; we catch the spirit of their lofty purpose, their high courage, their
    noble eloquence. When we drink deeply of the wisdom which history teaches, we come to
    understand that truth and justice, heroism and religion, which are the virtues of the
    greatest men, may be ours as easily as theirs; that opportunity for true men is ever
    present, and that the task set for each one of us is as sacred and important as any
    which has ever been entrusted to the human mind and will. Our thought is<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> widened, our
    hearts are strengthened, and we come to feel that it shall be well for others that we
    too have lived. When we have learned to be at home with lofty and generous natures,
    the heroic mood becomes natural to us.</p>
    <p>There are of course but few histories which have this tonic effect upon the mind
    and the will, but with these the lover of culture should make himself familiar. Each
    one must find the book he needs; and though he should find no help in a volume which
    time and the consent of the learned have consecrated, let him not be discouraged, but
    continue to seek and to read until he meet with the author who fills his soul with
    joy and opens to his wondering eyes visions of new worlds. To love any great book so
    that we read it&mdash;or at least those portions of it which especially appeal to
    us&mdash;many times, and always with new pleasure (as a mother never wearies of
    looking upon her child), until the thought and style of the author become almost our
    own, is to learn the secret of self-education; for he who understands and loves one
    great book is sure to find his way to the love and knowledge of other works of
    genius. He will not read chiefly to gain information, but he will read for exaltation
    of spirit, for enlightenment, for strength of soul, for the help which springs from
    contact with generous and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
    111]</a></span> awakened minds. He will mark his favorite passages and refer to them
    often, as one loves to revisit places where he has been happy; and these very
    pencil-marks will become dear to him as tokens of truth revealed, of wisdom gained,
    of joy bestowed. The best reading is that which most profoundly stimulates thought,
    which brings our own minds into active, conscious communion with the mind of the
    author; and hence the best poetry is the most efficacious and the most delightful aid
    to mental improvement.</p>
    <p>Poetry is, as Aristotle says, the most philosophic of all writing. It is also the
    writing which is most instinct with passion, with life. It springs from intense
    thought and feeling, and bears within itself the power to call forth thought and
    feeling. It is thought transfused with the glow of emotion, and consequently thought
    made beautiful, attractive, contagious. It is, to quote Wordsworth, "the breath and
    finer spirit of all knowledge; it is the impassioned expression which is in the
    countenance of all science." The poet has more enthusiasm and tenderness than other
    men, a more sensitive soul, a more comprehensive mind. His wider sympathy gives him
    greater insight; and his power to see absent things as though they were present
    enables him to bring the distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112"
    id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> and the past before our eyes, to make them live
    again in a new and immortal world; he stimulates the whole mind and appeals to every
    faculty of the soul. The greatest philosophers are, like Plato, poets too; and unless
    the historian is also a poet, there is no inspiration, no life in what he writes. It
    is as superficial and vulgar to sneer at poetry as to sneer at religion; and they
    alone are mockers who have eyes but for some counterfeit. To be able to read a true
    poet is not a gift of Nature; it is a faculty to be acquired. He creates, as
    Wordsworth says, the taste by which he is appreciated. To imagine we may read him as
    we read a frivolous novel is absurd; it may well happen we shall see no truth or
    beauty in him until patient study has made it plain. It often takes the world a
    hundred years or more to recognize a great poet; and a knowledge of his worth can be
    had by the student only at the price of patient labor. Wordsworth will attract
    scarcely any one at the first glance; the great number of readers will soon weary of
    him and throw him aside; but those who learn to understand him find in his writings
    treasures above all price. There are but a few great poems in the literatures of the
    different nations, but he who wishes to have a cultivated mind must, at the cost of
    whatever time and labor, make him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113"
    id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>self familiar with them; for there alone are found
    the best thoughts clothed in fittest words; there alone are rightly portrayed the
    noblest characters; there alone is the world of men and things transfigured by the
    imagination and illumined by the pure light of the mind. True poets help us to see,
    they teach us to admire, they lift our thoughts, they appeal to our higher nature;
    they give us nobler loves, more exalted aims, more spiritual purposes; they make us
    feel that to live for money or place is to lead a narrow and a slavish life; and to
    men around whom the fetters of material and hardening cares are growing, they cry and
    bid them&mdash;</p>

    <p>But even the greatest poets have weaknesses, and are great only by comparison.
    There is not one who however he may enchant and strengthen, does not also disappoint
    us. The perfect poet the future will bring; and to his coming we shall look with more
    eager expectation than if we foresaw man dowered with wings. The elevation we
    forebode is of the soul, not of the body. Progress we have already made. It is no
    longer possible for a true poet to sing of sensual delights; the man he creates is
    now no more the slave "of low am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114"

    <p>Writing is as great an aid to the cultivation of the mind as reading. It is indeed
    indispensable, and the accuracy of thought and expression of which Bacon speaks, is
    but one of its good results. "By writing," says Saint Augustine, "I have learned many
    things which nothing else had taught me." There is, of course, no question here of
    writing for publication. To do this no one should be urged. The farther we are from
    all thought of readers, the nearer are we to truth; and once an author has published,
    a sort of madness comes over him, and he seems to be doing nothing unless he continue
    to publish. The truly intellectual man leads an interior life; he dwells habitually
    in the presence of God, of Nature, and of his own soul; he swims in a current of
    ideas, looks out upon a world of truth and beauty; he would rather gain some new
    vision of the eternal reality than to have a mountain of gold or the suffrages of a
    whole people. The great hindrance is lack of the power of prolonged attention, of
    sustained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
    thought; and this the habit of serious writing gives. But the habit itself is
    difficult to acquire. At first in attempting to write we are discouraged to find how
    crude, how unreal, how little within our control our knowledge is; and it will often
    happen that we shall simply hold the pen in idleness, either because we find nothing
    to write, or because the proper way to express what we think eludes our efforts. When
    this happens day after day, the temptation will come to abandon our purpose, and to
    seek easier and less effective means of developing mental strength, or else we shall
    write carelessly and without thought, which is even a greater evil than not to write
    at all. In the writing of which I am thinking there is no question of style, of what
    critics and readers will say; all that is asked is that we apply our minds to things
    as they appear to us, and put in plain words what we see. Thus our style will become
    the expression of our thought and life. It will be the outgrowth of a natural method,
    and consequently will have genuine worth. What is written in this way should be
    preserved, not that others may see it, but that we ourselves by comparing our earlier
    with our later essays may be encouraged by the evidence of improvement. It is not
    necessary to make choice of a subject,&mdash;whatever interests us is<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> a fit theme; and
    if nothing should happen specially to interest us, by writing we shall gain interest
    in many things.</p>
    <p>The method here proposed requires serious application, perseverance, diligence: it
    is difficult; but they who have the courage to continue to write, undeterred by
    difficulties, will gain more than they hope for. They will grow in strength, in
    accuracy, in pliancy, in openness of mind; they will become capable of profound and
    just views, and will gradually rise to worlds of truth and beauty of which the common
    man does not dream. And it will frequently happen that there will be permanent value
    in what is written not to please the crowd or to flatter a capricious public opinion,
    or to win gold or applause, but simply in the presence of God and one's own soul to
    bear witness to truth. As the painter takes pallet and brush, the musician his
    instrument, each to perfect himself in his art, so he who desires to learn how to
    think should take the pen, and day by day write something of the truth and love, the
    hope and faith, which make him a living man.</p>

    <h4>GROWTH AND DUTY.</h4>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>Why stay we on the earth unless to grow?</p>
      <p><span style="margin-left: 18em;"><span class="smcap">Browning</span>.</span></p>
    </div>
    <p>What life is in itself we do not know, any more than we know what matter is in
    itself; but we know something of the properties of matter, and we also have some
    knowledge of the laws of life. Here it is sufficient to call attention to the law of
    growth, through which the living receive the power of self-development,&mdash;of
    bringing their endowments into act, of building up the being which they are. Whatever
    living thing is strong or beautiful has been made so by growth, since life begins in
    darkness and impotence. To grow is to be fresh and joyous. Hence the spring is the
    glad time; for the earth itself then seems to renew its youth, and enter on a fairer
    life. The growing grass, the budding leaves, the sprouting corn, coming as with
    unheard shout from regions of the dead, fill us with happy thoughts, because in them
    we behold the vigor of life, bringing promise of higher things.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
    <p>Nature herself seems to rejoice in this vital energy; for the insects hum, the
    birds sing, the lambs skip, and the very brooks give forth a merry sound. Growth
    leads us through Wonderland. It touches the germs lying in darkness, and the myriad
    forms of life spring to view; the mists are lifted from the valleys, and flowers
    bloom and shed fragrance through the air. Only the growing&mdash;those who each
    moment are becoming something more than they were&mdash;feel the worth and joyousness
    of life. Upon the youth nothing palls, for he is himself day by day rising into
    higher and wider worlds. To grow is to have faith, hope, courage.</p>
    <p>The boy who has become able to do what a while ago was impossible to him, easily
    believes that nothing is impossible; and as his powers unfold, his self-confidence is
    nourished; he exults in the consciousness of increasing strength, and cannot in any
    way be made to understand the doubts and faint-heartedness of men who have ceased to
    grow. Each hour he puts off some impotence, and why shall he not have faith in his
    destiny, and feel that he shall yet grow to be poet, orator, hero, or what you will
    that is great and noble? And as he delights in life, we take delight in him.</p>
    <p>In the same way a young race of people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119"
    id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> possesses a magic charm. Homer's heroes are
    barbarians; but they are inspiring, because they belong to a growing race, and we see
    in them the budding promise of the day when Alexander's sword shall conquer the
    world; when Plato shall teach the philosophy which all men who think must know; and
    when Pericles shall bid the arts blossom in a perfection which is the despair of
    succeeding generations. And so in the Middle Ages there is barbarism enough, with its
    lawlessness and ignorance; but there is also faith, courage, strength, which tell of
    youth, and point to a time of mature faculty and high achievement. There is the rich
    purple dawn which shall grow into the full day of our modern life.</p>
    <p>Here in this New World we are the new people, in whose growth what highest hopes,
    what heavenly promises lie! All the nations which are moving forward, are moving in
    directions in which we have gone before them,&mdash;to larger political and religious
    liberty; to wider and more general education; to the destroying of privilege and the
    disestablishment of churches; to the recognition of the equal rights not only of all
    men, but of all men and women.</p>
    <p>We also lead the way in the revolution which has been set in motion by the
    application of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg
    120]</a></span> science to mechanical purposes, one of the results of which is seen
    in the industrial and commercial miracles of the present century. It is our vigorous
    growth which makes us the most interesting and attractive of the modern peoples. For
    whether men love us, or whether they hate us, they find it impossible to ignore us,
    unless they wish to argue themselves unknown; and the millions who yearn for freedom
    and opportunity turn first of all to us.</p>
    <p>But observant minds, however much they may love America, however great their faith
    in popular government may be, cannot contemplate our actual condition without a sense
    of disquietude; for there are aspects of our social evolution which sadden and
    depress even the most patriotic and loyal hearts. It would seem, for instance, that
    with us, while the multitude are made comfortable and keen-witted, the individual
    remains common-place and weak; so that on all sides people are beginning to ask
    themselves what is the good of all this money and machinery if the race of godlike
    men is to die out, or indeed if the result is not to be some nobler and better sort
    of man than the one with whom we have all along been familiar. Is not the yearning
    for divine men inborn? In the heroic ages such men were worshiped as gods, and one of
    the calamities of times of degeneracy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121"
    id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> is the dying out of faith in the worth of true
    manhood caused by the disappearance of superior men. Such men alone are memorable,
    and give to history its inspiring and educating power. The ruins of Athens and Rome,
    the cathedrals and castles of Europe, uplift and strengthen the heart, because they
    bid us reflect what thoughts and hopes were theirs who thus could build.</p>
    <p>How quickly kings and peasants, millionaires and paupers, become a common,
    undistinguished crowd! But the hero, the poet, the saint, defy the ages and remain
    luminous and separate like stars. They&mdash;</p>

    <p>The soul, which makes man immortal, has alone the power to make him beneficent and
    beautiful.</p>
    <p>But in this highest kind of man, in whom soul&mdash;that is, faith, hope, love,
    courage, intellect&mdash;is supreme, we Americans, who are on the crest of the
    topmost waves of the stream of tendency, are not rich. We have our popular heroes;
    but so has every petty people, every tribe its heroes. The dithyrambic prose in which
    it is the fashion to celebrate our conspicuous men has a hollow sound, very like
    cant. A marvelous development of wealth and numbers has<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> taken place in America; but what
    American&mdash;poet, philosopher, scientist, warrior, ruler, saint&mdash;is there who
    can take his place with the foremost men of all this world? The American people seem
    still to be somewhat in the position of our new millionaires: their fortune is above
    them, overshadows, and oppresses them. They live in fine houses, and have common
    thoughts; they have costly libraries, and cheap culture; and their rich clothing
    poorly hides their coarse breeding. Nor does the tendency seem to be toward a nobler
    type of manhood.</p>
    <p>The leaders of the Revolution, the framers of the Federal Constitution, the men
    who contended for State-rights, and still more those who led in the great struggle
    for human rights were of stronger and nobler mold than the politicians who now crowd
    the halls of Congress. The promise of a literature which a generation ago budded
    forth in New England was, it appears, delusive. What a sad book is not that recently
    issued from the press on the poets of America! It is the chapter on snakes in Ireland
    which we have all read,&mdash;there are none. And are not our literary men whom it is
    possible to admire and love either dead or old enough to die?</p>
    <p>All this, however, need not be cause for discouragement, if in the generations
    which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
    springing up around us, and which are soon to enter upon the scene of active life, we
    could discover the boundless confidence, the high courage, the noble sentiments,
    which make the faults of youth more attractive than the formal virtues of a maturer
    age. But youth seems about to disappear from our life, to leave only children and
    men. For a true youth the age of chivalry has not passed, nor has the age of faith,
    nor the age of poetry, nor the age of aught that is godlike and ideal. To our young
    men, however, high thoughts and heroic sentiments are what they are to a railroad
    president or a bank cashier,&mdash;mere nonsense. Life for them is wholly prosaic and
    without illusions. They transform ideas into interests, faith into a speculation, and
    love into a financial transaction. They have no vague yearnings for what cannot be;
    hardly have they any passions. They are cold and calculating. They deny themselves,
    and do not believe in self-denial; they are active, and do not love labor; they are
    energetic, and have no enthusiasm; they approach life with the hard, mechanical
    thoughts with which a scientist studies matter. Their one idea is success, and
    success for them is money. Money means power, it means leisure, it means
    self-indulgence, it means display; it means, in a word, the thousand comforts and
    luxuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
    which, in their opinion, constitute the good of life.</p>
    <p>In aristocratic societies the young have had a passion for distinction. They have
    held it to be an excellent thing to belong to a noble family, to occupy an elevated
    position, to wear the glittering badges of birth and of office. In ages of religious
    faith they have been smitten with the love of divine ideals; they have yearned for
    God, and given all the strength of their hearts to make his will prevail. But to our
    youth distinction of birth is fictitious, and God is problematic; and so they are
    left face to face with material aims and ends; and of such aims and ends money is the
    universal equivalent.</p>
    <p>Now, it could not ever occur to me to think of denying that the basis of human
    life, individual and social, is material. Matter is part of our nature; we are bedded
    in it, and by it are nourished. It is the instrument we must use even when we think
    and love, when we hope and pray. Upon this foundation our spiritual being is built;
    upon this foundation our social welfare rests.</p>
    <p>Concern for material interests is one of the chief causes of human progress; since
    nothing else so stimulates to effort, and effort is the law of growth. The savage who
    has no conception of money, but is satisfied with what Nature pro<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>vides, remains
    forever a savage. Habits of industry, of order, of punctuality, of economy and
    thrift, are, to a great extent, the result of our money-getting propensities. Our
    material wants are more urgent, more irresistible; they press more constantly upon us
    than any other; and those whom they fail to rouse to exertion are, as a rule,
    hopelessly given over to indolence and sloth. In the stimulus of these lower needs,
    then, is found the impulse which drives men to labor; and without labor welfare is
    not possible.</p>

    <p>Whatever enables man to overcome his inborn love of ease is, in so far, the source
    of good. Now, money represents what more than anything else has this stimulating
    power. It is the equivalent of what we eat and drink, of the<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> homes we live in, of the comforts
    with which we surround ourselves, of the independence which makes us free to go here
    or there, to do this or that,&mdash;to spend the winter where orange blossoms perfume
    the soft air, and the summer where ocean breezes quicken the pulse of life. It
    unlocks for us the treasury of the world, opens to our gaze whatever is sublime or
    beautiful; introduces us to the master-minds who live in their works; it leads us
    where orators declaim, and singers thrill the soul with ecstasy. Nay, more, with it
    we build churches, endow schools, and provide hospitals and asylums for the weak and
    helpless. It is, indeed, like a god of this nether world, holding dominion over many
    spheres of life and receiving the heart-worship of millions.</p>
    <p>Yet, if we make money and its equivalents a life-purpose&mdash;the aim and end of
    our earthly hopes&mdash;our service becomes idolatry, and a blight falls upon the
    nobler self. Money is the equivalent of what is venal,&mdash;of all that may be
    bought or sold; but the best, the godlike, the distinctively human, cannot be bought
    or sold. A rich man can buy a wife, but not a woman's love; he can buy books, but not
    an appreciative mind; he can buy a pew, but not a pure conscience; he can buy men's
    votes and flattery, but not their respect. The money-<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>world is visible, material,
    mechanical, external; the world of the soul, of the better self, is invisible,
    spiritual, vital. God's kingdom is within. What we have is not what we are; and the
    all-important thing is to be, and not to have. Our possessions belong to us only in a
    mechanical way. The poet's soul owns the stars and the moonlit heavens, the mountains
    and rivers, the flowers and the birds, more truly than a millionaire owns his bonds.
    What I know is mine, and what I love is mine; and as my knowledge widens and my love
    deepens, my life is enlarged and intensified. But, since all human knowledge is
    imperfect and narrow, the soul stretches forth the tendrils of faith and hope.
    Looking upon shadows, we believe in realities; possessing what is vain and empty, we
    trust to the future to bring what is full and complete.</p>
    <p>All noble literature and life has its origin in regions where the mind sees but
    darkly; where faith is more potent than knowledge; where hope is larger than
    possession, and love mightier than sensation. The soul is dwarfed whenever it clings
    to what is palpable and plain, fixed and bounded. Its home is in worlds which cannot
    be measured and weighed. It has infinite hopes, and longings, and fears; lives in the
    conflux of immensities; bathes on shores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128"
    id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> where waves of boundless yearning break. Borne on
    the wings of time, it still feels that only what is eternal is real,&mdash;that what
    death can destroy is even now but a shadow. To it all outward things are formal, and
    what is less than God is hardly aught. In this mysterious, super-sensible world all
    true ideals originate, and such ideals are to human life as rain and sunshine to the
    corn by which it is nourished.</p>
    <p>What hope for the future is there, then, when the young have no enthusiasm, no
    heavenly illusions, no divine aspirations, no faith that man may become godlike, more
    than poets have ever imagined, or philosophers dreamed?&mdash;when money, and what
    money buys, is the highest they know, and therefore the highest they are able to
    love?&mdash;when even the ambitious among them set out with the deliberate purpose of
    becoming the beggars of men's votes; of winning an office the chief worth of which,
    in their eyes, lies in its emoluments?&mdash;when even the glorious and far-sounding
    voice of fame for them means only the gabble and cackle of notoriety?</p>
    <p>The only example which I can call to mind of an historic people whose ideals are
    altogether material and mechanical, is that of China. Are we, then, destined to
    become a sort of Chinese Empire, with three hundred millions of human beings, and not
    a divine man or woman?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
    129]</a></span></p>
    <p>Is what Carlyle says is hitherto our sole achievement&mdash;the bringing into
    existence of an almost incredible number of bores&mdash;is this to be the final
    outcome of our national life? Is the commonest man the only type which in a
    democratic society will in the end survive? Does universal equality mean universal
    inferiority? Are republican institutions fatal to noble personality? Are the people
    as little friendly to men of moral and intellectual superiority as they are to men of
    great wealth! Is their dislike of the millionaires but a symptom of their aversion to
    all who in any way are distinguished from the crowd? And is this the explanation of
    the blight which falls upon the imagination and the hearts of the young?</p>
    <p>Ah! surely, we who have faith in human nature, who believe in freedom and in
    popular government, can never doubt what answer must be given to all these questions.
    A society which inevitably represses what is highest in the best sort of men is an
    evil society. A civilization which destroys faith in genius, in heroism, in sanctity,
    is the forerunner of barbarism. Individuality is man's noblest triumph over fate, his
    most heavenly assertion of the freedom of the soul; and a world in which
    individuality is made impossible is a slavish world. There man dwindles, becomes one
    of a multitude, the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
    130]</a></span>personal product of a general law; and all his godlike strength and
    beauty are lost. Is not one true poet more precious than a whole generation of
    millionaires; one philosopher of more worth than ten thousand members of Congress;
    one man who sees and loves God dearer than an army of able editors?</p>
    <p>The greater our control of Nature becomes, the more its treasures are explored and
    utilized, the greater the need of strong personality to counteract the fatal force of
    matter. Just as men in tropical countries are overwhelmed and dwarfed by Nature's
    rich profusion, so in this age, in which industry and science have produced resources
    far beyond the power of unassisted Nature, only strong characters, marked
    individualities, can resist the influence of wealth and machinery, which tend to make
    man of less importance than that which he eats and wears,&mdash;to make him
    subordinate to the tools he uses.</p>
    <p>From many sides personality, which is the fountain-head of worth, genius, and
    power, is menaced. The spirit of the time would deny that God is a Person, and holds
    man's personality in slight esteem, as not rooted in the soul, but in aggregated
    atoms. The whole social network, in whose meshes we are all caught, cripples and
    paralyzes individuality. We must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131"
    id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> belong to a party, to a society, to a ring, to a
    clique, and deliver up our living thought to these soulless entities. Or, if we
    remain aloof from such affiliation, we must have no honest conviction, no fixed
    principles, but fit our words to business and professional interests, and conform to
    the exigencies of the prevailing whim. The minister is hired to preach not what he
    believes, but what the people wish to hear; the congressman is elected to vote not in
    the light of his own mind, but in obedience to the dictates of those who send him;
    the newspaper circulates not because it is filled with words of truth and wisdom, but
    because it panders to the pruriency and prejudice of its patrons; and a book is
    popular in inverse ratio to its individuality and worth. Our National Library is
    filled with books which have copyright, but no other right, human or divine, to exist
    at all; and when one of us does succeed in asserting his personality, he usually only
    makes himself odd and ridiculous. He rushes into polygamous Mormonism, or buffoon
    revivalism, or shallow-minded atheism; nay, he will even become an anarchist, because
    a few men have too much money and too little soul. What we need is neither the
    absence of individuality nor a morbid individuality, but high and strong
    personalities.</p>
    <p>If our country is to be great and forever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132"
    id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> memorable, something quite other than wealth and
    numbers will make it so. Were there but question of countless millions of dollars and
    people, then indeed the victory would already have been gained. If we are to serve
    the highest interests of mankind, and to mark an advance in human history, we must do
    more than establish universal suffrage, and teach every child to read and write. As
    true criticism deals only with men of genius or of the best talent, and takes no
    serious notice of mechanical writers and book-makers, so true history loses sight of
    nations whose only distinction lies in their riches and populousness.</p>
    <p>The noblest and most gifted men and women are alone supremely interesting and
    abidingly memorable. We have already reached a point where we perceive the unreality
    of the importance which the chronicles have sought to give to mere kings and
    captains. If the king was a hero, we love him; but if he was a sot or a coward, his
    jeweled crown and purple robes leave him as unconsidered by us as the beggar in his
    rags. Whatever influence, favorable or unfavorable, democracy may exert to make easy
    or difficult the advent of the noblest kind of man, an age in which the people think
    and rule will strip from all sham greatness its trappings and tinsel. The parade hero
    and windy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
    orator will be gazed at and applauded, but they are all the while transparent and
    contemptible. The scientific spirit, too, which now prevails, is the foe of all
    pretense; it looks at things in their naked reality, is concerned to get a view of
    the fact as it is, without a care whether it be a beautiful or an ugly, a sweet or a
    bitter truth. The fact is what it is, and nothing can be gained by believing it to be
    what it is not.</p>
    <p>This is a most wise and human way of looking at things, if men will only not
    forget that the mind sees farther than the eye, that the heart feels deeper than the
    hand; and that where knowledge fails, faith is left; where possession is denied, hope
    remains. The young must enter upon their life-work with the conviction that only what
    is real is true, good, and beautiful; and that the unreal is altogether futile and
    vain.</p>
    <p>Now, the most real thing for every man, if he is a man, is his own soul. His
    thought, his love, his faith, his hope, are but his soul thinking, loving, believing,
    hoping. His joy and misery are but his soul glad or sad. Hence, so far as we are able
    to see or argue, the essence of reality is spiritual; and since the soul is conscious
    that it is not the supreme reality, but is dependent, illumined by a truth higher
    than itself, nourished by a love larger than its own,<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> it has a dim vision of the Infinite
    Being as essentially real and essentially spiritual. A living faith in this infinite
    spiritual reality is the fountain-head not only of religion, but of noble life. All
    wavering here is a symptom of psychic paralysis. When the infinite reality becomes
    questionable, then all things become material and vile. The world becomes a world of
    sight and sound, of taste and touch. The soul is poured through the senses and
    dissipated; the current of life stagnates, and grows fetid in sloughs and marshes.
    Minds for whom God is the Unknowable have no faith in knowledge at all, except as the
    equivalent of weight and measure, of taste and touch and smell.</p>
    <p>Now, if all that may be known and desired is reduced to this material expression,
    how dull and beggarly does not life become,&mdash;mere atomic integration and
    disintegration, the poor human pneumatic-machine purring along the dusty road of
    matter, bound and helpless and soulless as a clanking engine! No high life, in
    individuals or nations, is to be hoped for, unless it is enrooted in the infinite
    spiritual reality,&mdash;in God. It is forever indubitable that the highest is not
    material, and no argument is therefore needed to show that when spiritual ideals lose
    their power of attraction, life sinks to lower beds.</p>
    <p>Sight is the noblest sense, and the starlit<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> sky is the most sublime object we
    can behold. But what do we in reality see there? Only a kind of large tent, dimly
    lighted with gas jets. This is the noblest thing the noblest sense reveals. But let
    the soul appear, and the tent flies into invisible shreds; the heavens break open
    from abyss to abyss, still widening into limitless expanse, until imagination reels.
    The gas jets grow into suns, blazing since innumerable ages with unendurable light,
    and binding whole planetary systems into harmony and life. So infinitely does the
    soul transcend the senses! The world it lives in is boundless, eternal, sublime. This
    is its home; this the sphere in which it grows, and awakens to consciousness of
    kinship with God. This is the fathomless, shoreless abyss of being wherein it is
    plunged, from which it draws its life, its yearning for the absolute, its undying
    hope, its love of the best, its craving for immortality, its instinct for eternal
    things. To condemn it to work merely for money, for position, for applause, for
    pleasure, is to degrade it to the condition of a slave. It is as though we should
    take some supreme poet or hero and bid him break stones or grind corn,&mdash;he who
    has the faculty to give to truth its divinest form, and to lift the hearts of nations
    to the love of heavenly things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136"
    id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
    <p>Whatever our lot on earth may be&mdash;whether we toil with the hand, with the
    brain, or with the heart&mdash;we may not bind the soul to any slavish service. Let
    us do our work like men,&mdash;till the soil, build homes, refine brute matter, be
    learned in law, in medicine, in theology; but let us never chain our souls to what
    they work in. No earthly work can lay claim to the whole life of man; for every man
    is born for God, for the Universe, and may not narrow his mind. We must have some
    practical thing to do in the world,&mdash;some way of living which will place us in
    harmony with the requirements and needs of earthly life; and what this daily business
    of ours shall be, each one, in view of his endowments and surroundings, must decide
    for himself.</p>
    <p>It is well to bear in mind that every kind of life has its advantages, except an
    immoral life. Whatever we make of ourselves, then,&mdash;whether farmers, mechanics,
    lawyers, doctors, or priests,&mdash;let us above all things first have a care that we
    are men; and if we are to be men, our special business work must form only a part of
    our life-work. The aim&mdash;at least in this way alone can I look at human
    life&mdash;is not to make rich and successful bankers, merchants, farmers, lawyers,
    and doctors, but to make noble and enlightened men. Hence the final thought<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> in all work is
    that we work not to have more, but to be more; not for higher place, but for greater
    worth; not for fame, but for knowledge. In a word, the final thought is that we labor
    to upbuild the being which we are, and not merely to build round our real self with
    marble and gold and precious stones. This is but the Christian teaching which has
    transformed the world; which declares that it is the business of slaves even, of
    beggars and outcasts, to work first of all for God and the soul. The end is infinite,
    the aim must be the highest. Not to know this, not to hear the heavenly invitation,
    is to be shut out from communion with the best; is to be cut off from the source of
    growth; is to be given over to modes of thought which fatally lead to mediocrity and
    vulgarity of life.</p>

    <p>We cannot set a limit to the knowledge and love of man, because they spring from
    God, and move forever toward him who is without limit. That we have been made capable
    of this ceaseless approach to an infinite ideal is the radical fact in our nature.
    Through this we are human; through this we are immortal; through this we are lifted
    above matter, look through the rippling stream of time on the calm ocean of eternity,
    and beyond the utmost bounds of space, see simple being,&mdash;life and thought and
    love, deathless, imageless, absolute. This ideal creates the law of duty, for it
    makes the distinction between right and wrong. Hence the first duty of man is to make
    himself like God, through knowledge ever-widening, through love ever-deepening,
    through life ever-growing.</p>
    <p>So only can we serve God, so only can we love him. To be content with ignorance is
    infidelity to his infinite truth. To rest in a lesser love is to deny the boundless
    charity which holds the heavens together and makes them beautiful, which to every
    creature gives its fellow, which for the young bird makes the nest, for the child the
    mother's breast, and in the heart of man sows the seed of faith and hope and heavenly
    pity.</p>
    <p>Ceaseless growth toward God,&mdash;this is the ideal, this is the law of human
    life, proposed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg

    <p>It is man's chief blessedness that there lie in his nature infinite possibilities
    of growth. The growth of animals comes quickly to an end, and when they cease to grow
    they cease to be joyful; but man, whose bodily development even is slow, is capable
    of rising to wider knowledge and purer love through unending ages. Hence even when he
    is old,&mdash;if he has lived for what is great and exalted,&mdash;his mind is clear,
    his heart is tender, and his soul is glad. Only those races are noble, only those
    individuals are worthy, who yield without reserve to the power of this impulse to
    ceaseless progress. Behold how the race from which we have sprung&mdash;the
    Aryan&mdash;breaks forth into ever new developments of strength and beauty in Greece,
    in Italy, in France, in England, in Germany, in America; creating literature,
    philosophy, sci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg
    140]</a></span>ence, art; receiving Christian truth, and through its aid rising to
    diviner heights of wisdom, power, freedom, love, and knowledge.</p>
    <p>And so there are individuals&mdash;and they are born to teach and to
    rule&mdash;for whom to live is to grow; who, forgetting what they have been, and what
    they are, think ever only of becoming more and more. Their education is never
    finished; their development is never complete; their work is never done. From
    victories won they look to other battlefields; from every height of knowledge they
    peer into the widening nescience; from all achievements and possessions they turn
    away toward the unapproachable Infinite, to whom they are drawn. Walking in the
    shadow of the too great light of God, they are illumined, and they are darkened. This
    makes Newton think his knowledge ignorance; this makes Saint Paul think his heroic
    virtue naught. Oh, blessed men, who make us feel that we are of the race of God; who
    measure and weigh the heavens; who love with boundless love; who toil and are
    patient; who teach us that workers can wait! They are in love with life; they yearn
    for fuller life. Life is good, and the highest life is God; and wherever man grows in
    knowledge, wisdom, and strength, in faith, hope, and love, he walks in the way of
    heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
    <p>To you, young gentlemen, who are about to quit these halls, to continue amid other
    surroundings the work of education which here has but begun, what words shall I more
    directly speak? If hitherto you have wrought to any purpose, you will go forth into
    the world filled with resolute will and noble enthusiasm to labor even unto the end
    in building up the being which is yourself, that you may unceasingly approach the
    type of perfect manhood. This deep-glowing fervor of enthusiasm for what is highest
    and best is worth more to you, and to any man, than all that may be learned in
    colleges. If ambition is akin to pride, and therefore to folly, it is none the less a
    mighty spur to noble action; and where it is not found in youth, budding and
    blossoming like the leaves and flowers in spring, what promise is there of the ripe
    fruit which nourishes life? The love of excellence bears us up on the swift wing and
    plumes of high desire,&mdash;</p>

    <p>Do not place before your eyes the standard of vulgar success. Do not say, I will
    study, labor, exercise myself, that I may become able to get wealth or office, for to
    this kind of work the necessities of life and the tendency of the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> age will drive
    you; whereas, if you hope to be true and high, it is your business to hold yourselves
    above the spirit of the age. It is our worst misfortune that we have no ideals. Our
    very religion, it would seem, is not able to give us a living faith in the reality of
    ideals; for we are no longer wholly convinced that souls live in the atmosphere of
    God as truly as lungs breathe the air of earth. We find it difficult even to think of
    striving for what is eternal, all-holy, and perfect, so unreal, so delusive do such
    thoughts seem.</p>
    <p>Who will understand that to be is better than to have, and that in truth a man is
    worth only what he is? Who will believe that the kingdom of this world, not less than
    the kingdom of Heaven, lies within? Who, even in thinking of the worth of a pious and
    righteous life, is not swayed by some sort of honesty-best-policy principle? We love
    knowledge because we think it is power; and virtue, because we are told as a rule it
    succeeds. Ah! do you love knowledge for itself?&mdash;for it is good, it is godlike
    to know. Do you love virtue for its own sake?&mdash;for it is eternally and
    absolutely right to be virtuous. Instead of giving your thoughts and desires to
    wealth and position, learn to know how little of such things a true and wise man
    needs; for the secret of a happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143"
    id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> life does not lie in the means and opportunities of
    indulging our weaknesses, but in knowing how to be content with what is reasonable,
    that time and strength may remain for the cultivation of our nobler nature. Ask God
    to inspire you with some great thought, some abiding love of what is excellent, which
    may fill you with gladness and courage, and in the midst of the labors, the trials,
    and the disappointments of life, keep you still strong and serene.</p>

    <p>What is so delightful as spring weather? To it, whatever mystery life can make
    plain, it reveals. There is universal utterance. Water leaps from its winding sheet
    of snow; the streams spring out to wander till they find their source; the corn
    sprouts to receive the sun's warm kiss; the buds unfold, the blossoms send forth
    fragrance, the heavens weep for joy; the birds sing, the children shout, and the
    fuller pulse of life gives, even to the old, fresh thoughts and young desires. Now,
    what is all this but a symbol of the soul, which feels the urgency of God calling
    upon it to make itself alive in him and in his universe of truth and beauty?</p>
    <p>But the season of growth is also the time of blight. A hundred germs perish for
    one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
    ripens into wholesome fruit; a hundred young lives suffer physical or moral ruin for
    one that develops into some likeness of true manhood. And upon what slight causes
    success or failure seems to depend!</p>
    <p>As a mere word, a glance, will bring the blood to a maiden's cheek, so may it sow
    the germ of moral death in the heart of youth. How helpless and ignorant the young
    are in their seeming strength and smartness: how self-sufficient in their unwisdom,
    how little amenable to reason, how slow to perceive true ideals. What patient,
    persevering effort is required to form character, and what a little thing will poison
    life in its source! How easy it is to see and understand what is coarse and evil, how
    difficult to appreciate what is pure and excellent. How quickly a boy learns to find
    pleasure in what is animal or brutal; but what infinite pains must be taken before he
    is won to the love of truth and goodness. Caricature delights him, and he has no eyes
    for the chaste beauty of perfect art. The story of an outlaw fills him with
    enthusiasm, and the heroic struggles of godlike souls are for him meaningless. He
    gazes with envious awe upon some vulgar rich man, and finds a philosopher, or a
    saint, only queer. He studies because he has been sent to school, where ignorance
    will expose him to ridi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
    146]</a></span>cule and humiliation, and possibly too, because he is told that
    knowledge will help him to win money and influence. However great his proficiency, he
    is in truth but a barbarian, without wisdom, without reverence, without gentleness.
    He has been brought only in a vague way into communion with the conscious life of the
    race; he has no true conception of the dignity of souls, no sense of the beauty of
    modest and unselfish action. He mistakes rudeness for strength, boastfulness for
    ability, disrespect for independence, profanity for manliness, brutality for
    courage.</p>
    <p>And to add to his misfortune, he is blind to his own weakness and ignorance. A
    sneer or a jest is his reply to the voice of wisdom, as with a light heart he walks
    in the road to ruin; and thus it happens that for one who becomes a true and noble
    man, a hundred go astray or sink into an unintelligent and vulgar kind of life. This
    fact is concealed from the eyes of the young, from the eyes of the multitude, indeed.
    As we hide the dead in the earth that we may quickly forget our loss, so society
    buries from sight and thought those who fail. Their number is so great that the
    oblivion which soon overwhelms them is needful to save even the brave from
    discouragement. Of a hundred college boys the lives of twenty-five will be
    ruined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> by
    dissipation, by sensual indulgence; twenty-five others will be wrecked by unhappy
    marriages, foolish financial schemes, dishonesty and indolence; of the remaining
    fifty, forty, let us say, will manage to get on without loss of respectability, while
    the ten (who are still left) will win a sort of notoriety by getting rich or by
    getting elected to office. Of the hundred will one become a saint, a philosopher, a
    poet, a statesman, or even a man of superior ability in natural knowledge or
    literature? And if this estimate is rightly made they all fail; and the emergence of
    a high and noble mind is so improbable that it may almost be looked upon, like the
    birth of a genius, as an accident, so impossible is it, with our limited view, to
    bring such cases within the domain of law. These hundred college boys have been taken
    from a thousand youths. The nine hundred have remained outside the doors which open
    into the halls of culture, away from the special influences which thought and
    ingenuity have created to develop and perfect man's endowments. As they are less
    favored, we demand less of them, and are content to have them reinforce the
    unenlightened army of laborers and money-getters. But when we come among those to
    whom leisure and opportunity are given that they may learn to think truly and to act
    nobly, and find that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
    148]</a></span> they fail in this, as nearly all of them do fail, we are disappointed
    and saddened. The thoughtless imagine that those who provide food and shelter do the
    most important work; but such work is the most important only where there is no
    intellectual, moral, or religious life. That is most necessary which nourishes the
    highest faculty, and wherever civilization exists, enlightened minds and great
    characters are indispensable. The animal and the savage, without much difficulty,
    find what satisfies appetite; but God appoints that only living souls shall provide
    what keeps souls alive. Now this soul-life, which manifests itself in thought, in
    conduct, in hope, faith, and love, makes us human and lifts us above every other kind
    of earthly existence. It is our distinctive attribute, the godlike side of our being,
    which, under penalty of sinking to lower worlds, we must bring out and cultivate. The
    plant is alive. By its own energy it springs from darkness, it grows, it waves its
    green leaves beneath the blue heavens; but it is blind, deaf and dumb, senseless,
    dead to the world of sight and sound, of taste and smell. The animal too is alive,
    and in a higher way: for all the glories of Nature are painted upon its eye; all
    sounds strike upon its ear; it moves about and has all the sensations of physical
    pleasure of which man is capable; but it is without thought, without<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> sense of right
    and wrong, without imagination, without hope and faith. It is plain then that human
    life, in its highest sense, is life of the soul,&mdash;a life of thought and love, of
    faith and hope, of imagination and desire; and men are high or low as they partake
    more or less of this true life. By this standard, and by no other, reason requires
    that we form an estimate of human worth. To be a king, to have money, to live in
    splendor, to meet with approval from few or many,&mdash;is accidental, is something
    which may happen to an ignorant, a heartless, a depraved, a vulgar man. The most
    vicious and brutal of men have, again and again, held the most exalted positions, and
    as a rule cringing and lying, trickery and robbery, or speculation and gambling, have
    been and are the means by which great fortunes are acquired. Position, then, and
    money are distinguishable from worth; and they may be and often are found where the
    life of thought and love, of faith and hope, of imagination and desire, is almost
    wholly wanting. Now, it is this life&mdash;the only true human life&mdash;which
    education should bring forth and strengthen; and the failure to lead this life, of
    those who pass through our institutions of learning, is a subject of deep concern for
    all who observe and reflect; for among them we look for the leaders who shall cause
    wisdom and good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg
    150]</a></span>ness to prevail over ignorance and appetite. If those who receive the
    best nurture and care remain on the low plains of a hardly more than animal
    existence, what hope is there that the multitude shall rise to nobler ways of
    living?</p>
    <p>There is question here of the most vital interests; and if we discover the causes
    of the evil, a remedy may be found. These causes of failure lie partly in our
    environment and partly within ourselves. In the home, in which we receive the first
    and the most enduring impressions, true views and noble aims are frequently wanting;
    and thus false and low estimates of life are formed at a time when what we learn
    sinks into the very substance of the mind, and colors and shapes all our future
    seeing and loving. This primal experience accompanies us, and hangs about us like a
    mist to shut out the view of fairer worlds. Enthusiasm for intellectual and moral
    excellence is never roused, because our young souls were not made magnetic by the
    words and deeds of those whom we looked up to as gods. Fortunate is he who bears with
    him into the life-struggle pure memories of a happy home. When I think of the bees I
    have seen coming back to the hive, honey-laden, in the golden light of setting suns,
    when I was a boy at home, a feeling comes over me as though I had lived in paradise
    and been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
    driven forth into a bleak world. When one is young, and one's father and mother are
    full of health and joy; when the roses are blooming and the brooks are laughing to
    themselves from simple gladness, and the floating clouds and the silent stars seem to
    have human thoughts,&mdash;what more could we ask of God but to know that all this is
    eternal, and is from him?</p>
    <p>In such a mood, how easy it is to turn the childlike soul to the world of
    spiritual and immortal things. With what efficacy then a mother's soft voice teaches
    us that we were born upon this earth for no other purpose than to know truth, to love
    goodness, to do right, that so, having made ourselves godlike, we may forever be with
    God. And if these high lessons blend in our thought with memories which make home a
    type of heaven, how shall they not through life be a spur to noble endeavor to
    accomplish the task thus set us? When great-hearted, high-souled boys go forth to
    college from homes of intelligence and love, then is there well-founded hope that
    they shall grow to be wise and helpful men, who know and teach truth, who see and
    create beauty, who do and make others do what becomes a man. Of hardly less
    importance is the neighborhood in which our early years are passed, and next to the
    companionship of the home fireside, a boy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152"
    id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> best neighbor is Nature. Well for him shall it be,
    if, like colts and calves, and all happy young things, he is permitted to breath the
    wholesome air of woods and fields, to drink from flowing streams, to lie in the shade
    of trees on the green sward, or to stand alone beneath the silent starlit heavens
    until the thought and feeling of the infinite and eternal sink deep into his soul,
    and make it impossible that he should ever look upon the universe of time and space,
    or the universe of duty's law within his breast, in a shallow or irreverent spirit.
    Little shall be said to him, and little shall he speak, and to the unobservant he
    shall seem dull; but he is Nature's nursling, and she paints her colors on his brain
    and infuses her strength into his heart. She hardens him and teaches him patience;
    she shows him real things, fills him with the love of truth, and makes him understand
    that sham is shame.</p>
    <p>His progress may be slow; but he will persevere, he will have faith in the power
    of labor and of time, and when in after years we shall look about for a man with some
    Diogenes' lantern, there are a thousand chances to one that when we find him we shall
    find him country-born, not city-bred. Too soon is the town-boy made self-conscious;
    he is precocious; all the tricks and devices of civilization are known to<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> him; all
    artifices and contrivances he sees in shop-windows; the street, the theatre, the
    newspaper are the rivals of the home, and they quickly teach him irreverence and
    disobedience. He loses innocence, experience of evil gives him flippant views. He
    becomes wise in his own conceit; having eyes only for the surfaces of things, he
    easily persuades himself that he knows all. Of such a youth how shall any college
    make an enlightened, a noble, and a reverent man? But the home and the neighborhood
    are not our whole environment. As we are immersed in an atmospheric ocean, so do we
    swim in the current of our national life. To praise this life is easy. We all see and
    feel how vigorous it is, how confident, how eager. Here is a world of busy men and
    women, active in many directions. They found States, they build cities, they create
    wealth, they discuss all problems, they try all experiments, they hurry on to new
    tasks, and think they have done nothing while aught remains to do.</p>
    <p>They live in the midst of the excitement of ever-recurring elections, of
    speculation, of financial schemes and commercial enterprises. It is an unrestful,
    feverish, practical life, in which all the strong natures are thinking of doing
    something, of gaining something,&mdash;a life in the market-place, where high thought
    and noble conduct are all but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154"
    id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> impossible, where the effort to make one's self a
    man, instead of striving to get so many thousands of money, would seem ridiculous. It
    is a life of inventions and manufactures, of getting and spending, in which we bring
    forth and consume in a single century what it has taken Nature many thousand years to
    hoard. Our aim is to have more rather than to be more; our ideal is that of material
    progress; our praise is given to those who invent and discover the means of
    augmenting wealth. Liberty is opportunity to get rich; education is the development
    of the money-getting faculty. Our national life may, of course, be looked at from
    many sides, but the general drift of opinion and effort is in the direction here
    pointed out. Nine tenths of our thought and energy are given to material interests,
    and these interests represent nine tenths of our achievements. This may be true of
    men in general, it may be true also that material progress is a condition of moral
    and intellectual growth; but none the less is it true that right human life is a life
    of thought and love, of hope and faith, of imagination and desire. Consequently in a
    well-ordered society, the chief aim&mdash;nine tenths of all effort, let us
    say&mdash;will have for its object the creation of enlightened and loving men and
    women, whom faith and hope shall make strong, whom imagination shall refresh,<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> and the desire
    of perfection shall keep active. The aims which the ideals of democracy suggest are
    not wholly or chiefly material. We strive, indeed, to create a social condition in
    which comfort and plenty shall be within the reach of all; but the better among us
    understand that this is but an inferior part of our work, and they take no delight
    whatever in our great fortunes and great cities. If democracy is the best government,
    it follows that it is the kind of government which is most favorable to virtue,
    intelligence, and religion. It is faint praise to say that in America there is more
    enterprise, more wealth, than elsewhere. What we should strive to make ourselves able
    to say, is, that there is here a more truly human life, more public and private
    honesty, purity, sympathy, and helpfulness; more love of knowledge, more perfect
    openness to light, greater desire to learn, and greater willingness to accept truth
    than is to be found elsewhere. It should be our endeavor to create a world of which
    it may be said, there life is more pleasant, beauty more highly prized, goodness held
    in greater reverence, the sense of honor finer, the recognition of talent and worth
    completer than elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Wealth and population should be considered merely as means, which, if we ourselves
    do not sink beneath our fortune, we shall use to help<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> us to develop on a vast scale, a
    nobler, freer, and fairer life than hitherto has ever existed. We Americans have a
    great capacity for seeing things as they are. A thousand shams and glittering
    vanities have gone down before our straight-looking eyes; and because such things
    fail to impress us, we seem to be irreverent. We must look more steadfastly, deeper
    still, until we clearly perceive and understand that to live for money is to lead a
    false and vulgar life, to rest with complacency in mere numbers is to have a
    superficial and unreal mind. To form a right judgment of a people, as of individuals,
    we must consider what they are; not what they have, except in so far as their
    possessions are the result of work which at once forms and reveals character. And we
    must know that work is good only in as much as it helps to make life
    human,&mdash;that is, intelligent, moral and religious. And what we have the right to
    demand of those to whom we give a higher education is, that they shall body forth
    these principles in their lives and become leaders in the task of spreading them
    among the multitude. We demand, first of all, that they become men whose hearts are
    pure and loving, whose minds are open and enlightened, whose motives are benevolent
    and generous, whose purposes are high and religious; and if they<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> are such men, it
    shall matter little to what special pursuits they turn, for whatever their
    occupation, honor, truth, and intelligence shall go with them, bearing, like mercy, a
    blessing for those who give and a blessing for those who receive. The spirit in which
    they work shall be more than what they do, as they themselves shall be more than what
    they accomplish.</p>
    <p>A right spirit transforms the whole man, and the first and highest aim of the
    educator should be to impart a new heart, a new purpose, which shall bring into play
    forces that may oppose and overcome those faults of the young of which I have spoken,
    and which, if not corrected, lead to failure.</p>
    <p>And here we come to the causes of ill success which lie within ourselves. We have
    our individual qualities and defects, and we have also the qualities and defects of
    the people whence we are sprung, and of the time-spirit into which we are born. It is
    the aim of education, as it is the aim of religion, to lift us above the spirit of
    the age; but in attempting to do this, they who lose sight of what is true and
    beneficent in that spirit, commit a serious blunder. A national spirit, too, is a
    narrow, and often a harsh and selfish spirit; but when culture and religion strive to
    make us citizens of the world and universally benevolent, a care must be had
    that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> we
    retain what is strong and noble in the character we inherit from our ancestors.</p>
    <p>The lover of intellectual excellence, however, is little inclined to dwell with
    complacency either upon his own qualities, or upon the greatness of his country or
    his age. The untaught optimism which leads the crowd to exaggerate the worth of
    whatever they in any way identify with themselves, he looks upon with suspicion, if
    not with aversion. Self-complacency is pleasant; but truth alone is good, and they
    who think least are best content with themselves and with their world. He who seeks
    to improve his mind, neither boasts of his age and country, nor rails at them; but
    tries to understand them as he tries to know himself. The important knowledge here is
    of obstacles and defects; for when these are removed, to advance is easy. The first
    lesson which we must learn is that in the work of mental culture, time and patience
    are necessary elements. The young, who are eager and restless, find it difficult to
    work with patience and perseverance, especially when the reward of labor is remote,
    and in the excitement and hurry of American life, such work often seems to be
    impossible. But by this kind of work alone can true culture be acquired. It is this
    Buffoon means when he calls genius a great capacity for taking pains. When Albert
    D&uuml;rer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
    said, "Sir, it cannot be better done;" he simply meant that he had bestowed infinite
    pains upon his work. Now, they who are in a hurry cannot take pains; and they who
    work for money will take pains only in so far as it is profitable to do so. We must
    live in our work and love it for its own sake. To do work we love makes us happy,
    makes us free, and according to its kind educates us; and whatever its kind, it will
    at least teach us the sovereign virtue of patience, and give us something of the
    spirit of the old masters who in dingy shops ceased not from labor, and kept their
    cheerful serenity to the end, though the outcome was only the most perfect fiddle, or
    a deathless head. But they themselves had the souls of artists, and were honest men,
    who in their work found joy and freedom, and therefore what they did remains as a
    source of delight and inspiration. If we find it impossible to put our hearts into
    our work and consequently impossible to take infinite pains with it, then this is
    work for which we were not born. The impatient cannot love the labor by which the
    mind is cultivated, because impatience implies a sense of restraint, a lack of
    freedom. They are restless, easily grow weary or despondent, find fault with
    themselves and their task, and either throw off the yoke or bear it in a spirit of
    disappointment and bitter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
    160]</a></span>ness. As they fail to make themselves strong and serene, their work
    bears the marks of haste and feebleness, for work reveals character; it is the
    likeness of the doer, as style shows the man. Then the young are blinded by the
    glitter and glare of life, by the splendors of position and wealth; they are drawn to
    what is external; they would be here and there; they love the unchartered liberty of
    chance desires, and are easily brought to look upon the task of self-improvement as a
    slavish work. They would have done with study that they may be free, may enter into
    what they suppose to be a fair and rich heritage. They cannot understand that so long
    as they are narrow, sensual, and unenlightened, the possession of a world could not
    make them high or happy. They do not know that to have liberty, without the power of
    using it for worthy ends, is a curse not a blessing. They imagine that experience of
    the world's ways and wickedness will make them wise, whereas it will make them
    depraved.</p>
    <p>How can they realize that the good of life consists in being, and not in having?
    that we are worth what our knowledge, love, admiration, hope, faith, and desire make
    us worth? They will not perceive that happiness and unhappiness are conditions of
    soul, and consequently that the wise, the loving, and the strong, what<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ever their
    outward fortune, are happy, while the ignorant, the heartless, and the weak are
    miserable. To know ourselves, we should seek to discover the kind of life our
    influence tends to create. Consider the kind of world college boys make for
    themselves, the things they admire, the companions they find pleasant, the subjects
    in which they take interest, the books that delight them,&mdash;and one great cause
    of the failure of education will be made plain; for though they are sent to school to
    be taught by professors, their influence upon one another is paramount. Instead of
    helping one another to see that their real business is to educate themselves, they
    persuade one another that life is given for common ends and vulgar pleasures. Hence
    they look with envy upon their companions who are the sons of rich men, as they have
    not lived long enough to learn that the fate of four fifths of the sons of rich men
    in this country, is moral and physical ruin. If such is the public opinion of the
    world in which they live; and if even strong men are feeble in the presence of public
    opinion,&mdash;how shall we find fault with them for not being attracted by the
    ideals of intellectual and moral excellence. For the trained mind even to think is
    difficult, and for them independent thought is almost impossible. They do not know
    the little less than creative power of right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162"
    id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> education, or that as we are changed by action, we
    are transformed by thought. What patient labor may do to exalt and refine the mental
    faculties, until we become capable of entering into the life of every age and every
    people, has not been shown to them; and hence they are not inspired by the high hope
    of dwelling, in very truth, with all the noble and heroic souls who have passed
    through this world and left record of themselves. We bid the youth learn many things
    which he cannot but find both useless and uninteresting. And yet unless we discover
    the secret of winning him to the love of study, the educational value of what he
    learns is lost; for what leaves him unmoved, leaves him unimproved. His information
    and accomplishments are comparatively unimportant. What he himself is, and what his
    real self gives us grounds for hoping he shall become, is the true concern. To be
    able to translate &AElig;schylus or Plato is not a great thing; but it is a great
    thing to have the Greek's sense of what is fair, noble and intellectual. To be able
    to solve a complex mathematical problem may be unimportant; but to have the mental
    habit of accurate, close, patient thinking is important. It is easy to forget one's
    Greek or the higher mathematics; but an intellectual or a moral habit is not easily
    lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
    <p>He who has right habits will go farther and rise higher than he who has only
    brilliant attainments. It is an error, and a very common one, to suppose that
    education is merely, or chiefly, a mental process, and consequently that the best
    school is that in which the various kinds of knowledge are best taught. Our whole
    being, physical, intellectual, and moral, is subject to the law of education. We may
    educate the eye, the ear, the hand, the foot; and each member of the body may be
    trained in many ways. The eye of the microscopist has received a training different
    from that of the painter; the sculptor's hand has been taught a cunning unlike that
    of the surgeon; the voice of the orator is developed in one way, that of the singer
    in another. And so the faculties of the mind may be drawn forth, and each one in
    various ways. The powers of observation, of reflection, of intuition, of imagination,
    are all educable. One of the most important and most difficult lessons to learn is
    that of attention. We know only what we are conscious of, and we are conscious only
    of that to which we give heed. If we but hold the mind to any subject with
    perseverance, it will deliver its secret. The little knowledge we have is often vague
    and unreal, because we are heedless, because we have never taught ourselves to dwell
    in conscious communion with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg
    164]</a></span> the objects of thought. The trained eye sees innumerable beauties
    which are hidden from others, and so the mind which is taught to look right sees
    truths the uneducated can never know. We may be taught to judge as well as to look.
    Indeed, once we have learned to see things as they are, correct opinions and
    judgments naturally follow. All faculty is the result of education. Poets, orators,
    philosophers, and saints bring not their gifts into the world with them; but by
    looking and thinking, doing and striving, they rise from the poor elements of
    half-conscious life to the clear vision of truth and beauty. Natural endowments are
    not equal; but the chief cause of inequality lies in the unequal efforts which men
    make to develop their endowments. The lack of imagination in the multitude makes
    their life dull, uninteresting, and material, and it is assumed that we are born
    with, or without, imagination, and that there is no remedy for this misery. And those
    who admit that imagination is subject to the law of development, frequently hold that
    it should be repressed rather than strengthened. Doubtless the imagination can be
    cultivated, just as the eye or the ear, the judgment or the reason, can be
    cultivated; and since imagination, like faith, hope, and love, helps us to live in
    higher and fairer worlds, an educator is false to his calling<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> when he leaves it unimproved. The
    classics, and especially poetry, are the great means of intellectual culture, because
    more than anything else they have power to exalt and ennoble the imagination. To
    suppose that this faculty is one which only poets and artists need, is to take a
    shallow and partial view. The historian, the student of Nature, the statesman, the
    minister of religion, the teacher, the mechanic even, if they are to do good work,
    must possess imagination, which is at once an intellectual, a moral, and a religious
    faculty. It is the mother and mistress of faith, hope, and love. It is the source of
    great thoughts, of high aspirations, and of heavenly dreams. Without it the
    illimitable starlit expanse loses its sublimity, oceans and mountains their awfulness
    and majesty, flowers their beauty, home its sacred charm, youth its halo, and the
    grave its solemn mystery.</p>
    <p>Those powers within us which are directly related to conduct, the impulses to
    self-preservation, and to the propagation of the race, are subject to the law of
    education, not less than our physical and intellectual endowments. And the importance
    of dealing rightly with these powers is readily perceived if we reflect that conduct
    is the greater part of human life, which is a life of thought and love, of hope and
    faith, of imagination and desire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166"
    id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
    <p>As we can educate the faculties of thought and imagination, so can we develop the
    power to love, to hope, to believe, and to desire. When there is question of the
    intellect, teachers seek to impart information rather than to strengthen the mind,
    and when there is question of the moral nature, they have recourse to precepts and
    maxims instead of striving to confirm the will and to direct impulse. It is generally
    held, in fact, that will is a gift, not a growth, and the same view is taken of all
    our moral dispositions. We are supposed to receive from Nature a warm or a cold
    heart, a hopeful or a despondent temper, a believing or a skeptical turn of mind, a
    spiritual or a sensual bent. Now as I have already admitted, endowments are unlike;
    but what has this to do with the drift of the argument? Minds, though by nature
    unequal, may all be educated; and so wills may be educated, and so that which makes
    us capable of faith, hope, and desire, may be drawn forth, strengthened, and refined.
    Emerson, whose thought is predominantly spiritual, takes a low and material view of
    the moral faculties, confusing strength of will with health. "Courage," he says, "is
    the degree of circulation of the blood in the arteries.... When one has a plus of
    health, all difficulties vanish before it." But will is a moral rather than a<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> constitutional
    power; and in so far as it is moral, it may be cultivated and directed to noble aims
    and ends. And if the teacher perform this work with fine knowledge and tact, he
    becomes an educator; for upon the will, more than upon the intellectual faculties,
    success or failure depends. Whatever we are able to will, we are able to learn to do;
    and the best service we can render another is to rouse and confirm within him the
    will to live and to work, that he may make himself a complete man, that thus he may
    become a benefactor of men and a co-worker with God. The rational will, which is the
    educated will, should give impulse and guidance to all our thinking, loving, and
    doing. It should control appetite; it should nourish faith and hope; it should lead
    us on through the illusory world of sensual delights, through the hardly less
    illusory world of wealth and power, still bidding us look and see that the world to
    which the conscious self really belongs, is infinite and eternal, and that to seek to
    rest in aught else is to apostatize from reason and conscience. Thus it would awaken
    in us a divine discontent, a sacred unrest, which might urge us on through the
    darkness of appetite and the unwholesome air of avarice and ambition, whispering to
    us that our life-work is to know truth, to love beauty, to do righteousness. To
    none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> is the
    education of the will so necessary as to the lovers of intellectual excellence, for
    they who live in the world of ideas are easily content to let the world of deeds take
    care of itself. As the astronomer sees the earth lost like a grain of sand in
    infinite space, so to the wide and deep view of one who is familiar with the course
    of human thought and action, what any man, what the whole race of man, may do, can
    seem but insignificant. From the vanity and noise of actors who fret and storm for
    their brief hour, and then pass forever from life's stage, he flies to ideal worlds
    where truth never changes, where beauty never grows old, and lives more richly blest
    than lovers in Tempe or the dales of Arcady. And then the habit of looking at things
    from many sides leads to doubt, hesitation, and inaction. While the wise deliberate,
    the young and inexperienced have won or lost the battle. Thus the purely intellectual
    life tends to weaken faith, hope, and desire, which are the sources whence conduct
    springs, the drying up of which leaves us amid barren wastes, where high thinking, if
    it be not impossible, brings neither strength nor joy; for the secret of strength and
    joy lies in doing and not in thinking. It is a law of our nature that conduct brings
    the most certain and the most permanent satisfaction, and hence whatever our
    ideals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> the
    pursuit should be inspired by the sense of duty.</p>

    <p>Then only do we move with certain step when we hear God's voice bidding us go
    forward, as he commands the starry host to fly onward, and all living things to
    spring upward to light and warmth. When we understand that he has made progress the
    law of life, we learn to feel that not to grow is not to live. Then our view is
    enlarged; we become lovers of perfection; we cherish every gift, and in many ways we
    strive to cultivate the many powers which go to the making of a man. They all are
    from him, and from him is the effort by which they are improved. We were born to make
    ourselves alive in him and in his universe, and like the setter in the field, we
    stretch eye and ear and nose to catch whatever message may be borne to us from his
    boundless game park. We observe, reflect, compare; we read best books; we listen to
    whoever speaks what he knows and feels to be truth. We take delight in whatever in
    Nature is sublime or beautiful, and fresh thoughts and innocent hearts make<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> us glad.
    Wherever an atom thrills, there too is God, and in him we feel the thrill and are at
    home. Our faith grows pure; our hope is confirmed; and our love and sympathy identify
    us with an ever-widening sphere of life beyond us. The exclusive self passes into the
    larger movement of the social and religious world around us, which, as we now
    realize, is also within us, giving aims and motives to our love and self-devotion. We
    understand that what hurts another can never help us, and that our private good must
    tend to become a general blessing. Thus we find and love ourselves in the
    intellectual, moral, and religious life of the race, which is a type and symbol of
    the infinite life of God, the omen and promise of the soul's survival. As we become
    conscious of ourselves only through communion with what is not ourselves, so we truly
    live only when we live for God and the world he creates,&mdash;losing life that we
    may find it; dying, like seed-corn, that we may rise to a new and richer life. Not
    what gratifies our selfish or sensual nature will help us to lead this right human
    life; but that which illumines and deepens thought and love, which gives to faith a
    boundless scope, to hope an everlasting foundation, to desire the infinite beauty
    which, though unseen, is felt, like memory of music fled. The unseen world ceases to
    be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> future
    world; and is recognized as the very world in which we now think and love, and so
    intellectual and moral life passes into the sphere of religion. We no longer pursue
    ideals which forever elude us, but we become partakers of the divine life; for in
    giving ourselves to the Eternal and Infinite we find God in our souls. The ideal is
    made real; God is with us, and through faith, hope, and love we are one with him, and
    all is well. Henceforth in seeking to know more, to become more, we are animated by a
    divine spirit. Now we may grow old, still learning many things, still smitten with
    the love of beauty, still finding delight in fresh thoughts and innocent pleasures,
    and it may be that we shall be found to be teachers of wisdom and of holiness. Then,
    indeed, shall we be happy, for it is better to teach truth than to win battles. A
    war-hero supposes a barbarous condition of the race, and when all shall be civilized,
    they who know and love the most shall be held to be the greatest and the best.</p>

    <h4>UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.</h4>
    <p>As they who look on the ocean think of its vastness; of the many shores in many
    climes visited by its waves to ply "their priest-like task of clean ablution;" of
    cities and empires that rose beside its waters, flourished, decayed, and became a
    memory; of others that shall rise and also pass away, while the moving element
    remains,&mdash;so we to-day beholding ancient Faith, laying, in the New World, the
    cornerstone of an institution which better than anything else symbolizes the aim and
    tendency of modern life, find ourselves dwelling in thought upon what has been and
    what will be.</p>
    <p>On the one hand rises the venerable form of that religion whose voice re-echoed in
    the hearts of Abraham, Moses, David, and Isaiah; whose lips, when the Saviour spoke,
    uttered diviner truth and thrilled the hearts of men with purer love, living with
    them in deserts and catacombs, leading them along bloodstained ways to victory and
    peace, until at length the Church gleamed forth from amid the parting <span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>storm-clouds and
    shone like a mountain-built city bathed in sunlight. On the other stands the Genius
    of the Republic, the embodied spirit of the sovereign people, who, accepting as
    literal truth the Christian principles that God is a Father, and men brothers and
    therefore equal, strive to take from political society the blindness and fatality of
    natural law, and to endow it with the divine and human attributes of justice, mercy,
    and intelligence. From the very beginning our American history is full of religious
    zeal, of high courage and strong endeavor. When Columbus, saddened by the
    frivolousness or the perfidy of courts, but unshaken in his purpose, walked the
    streets of the Spanish capital, lonely and forsaken, the children, as he passed
    along, would point to their foreheads and smile, for was not his mind unhinged, and
    did he not believe the world was round and on the other side men walked like flies
    upon a ceiling? But a woman's heart understood that his folly was of the kind which
    is the wisdom of God, and with her help he set sail, not timidly or doubting like the
    Portuguese who for fifty years hugged the African coast, advancing and then receding,
    but facing the awful and untraveled ocean with a heart stronger than its storm-swept
    billows, he steered due west. In his journal, day after day, he wrote these simple
    but sublime words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
    174]</a></span> "That day he sailed westward, which was his course." And still, as
    hope rose and fell, as misgivings and terrors seized on his men, as the compass
    varied in inexplicable ways as though they were entering regions where the very laws
    of Nature change, the soul of the great admiral stood firm and each evening he wrote
    again the self-same words, "that day he sailed westward which was his course," until
    at length seeing what he foresaw, he gave to Christendom another world and enlarged
    the boundaries and scope of earthly life. What hearts had not the men who in New
    England, in Virginia, in Maryland, and elsewhere, settled in little bands on the edge
    of vast and unexplored regions, covered by interminable forests, where savages lay in
    wait, athirst for blood. We hear without surprise that wise and prudent men looked
    upon the early attempts to take possession of America as not less wild and visionary
    than the legendary exploits of Amadis de Gaul; but what Utopian dreamer, what poet
    soaring in the high regions of his fancy, could have imagined two centuries and a
    half ago the beauty, the power, the free and majestic sweep of the stream of human
    life which has poured across this continent? Who could have dared to hope that the
    religious exiles who sought here a home for the Christian conscience were a
    seed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> the
    least of all, which was destined to grow into a tree whose boughs should shelter the
    land, and bring refreshment to the weary and heavy-laden from every part of the
    earth?</p>
    <p>Who could have thought that these fugitives from the tyrant's power would, in
    little more than a century, grow like the tribes of Israel into a people able to
    withstand the onslaughts of the oppressor, and to abolish forever within their
    borders despotic rule? Who could have had faith that men of different creeds,
    speaking various tongues, bred in unlike social conditions, would here coalesce and
    co-operate for the general purposes of free government? Above all, who could have
    believed that a form of government rarely tried, even in small States, and when tried
    found practicable only for brief periods, would here become so stable, so strong,
    that every hamlet, every village, is self-poised and manages its own affairs? The
    achievement is greater than we are able to know; nor does it lie chiefly in the
    millions who coming from many lands have here made homes and found themselves free;
    nor in the building of cities, the clearing of forests, the draining of swamps, the
    binding of two oceans, and the opening of lines of rapid communication in every
    direction. Not to numbers or wealth do we owe our significance among the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> nations; but to
    the fact that we have shown that respect for law is compatible with civil and
    religious liberty; that a free people can become prosperous and strong, and preserve
    order without king or standing army; that the State and the Church can move in
    separate orbits and still co-operate for the common welfare; that men of different
    races and beliefs may live together in peace; that in spite of an abnormally rapid
    increase of population and of wealth, and of the many evils thence resulting, the
    prevailing tendency is to sanity of thought and sentiment, thus plainly manifesting
    the vigor of our life and institutions; that the government of the majority, where
    men put their trust in God and in knowledge, is in the end the government of the good
    and the wise. We have thus helped to establish confidence in human nature; to prove
    that man's instincts, like the laws of Nature, are conservative; to show that the
    enthusiasts who would overturn everything, destroy everything, have no abiding place
    or influence in the affairs of a free people, as volcanic and cyclonic forces are but
    transitory and superficial in their action upon the earth. We have shown in a word
    that under a popular government, where men are faithful and intelligent, it is as
    impossible that society should become chaotic as that the planets should dissolve
    into star dust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg
    177]</a></span></p>
    <p>It is difficult to realize what an advance this is on all previous views of
    political life; how full it is of promise, how accordant with the sentiments of the
    noblest minds in every part of the world. It gives us the leading place among the
    nations which are moving along rising ways to higher and freer life. To turn to the
    Catholic Church in America; all observers remark its great development here, the
    rapid increase in the number of its adherents, its growth in wealth and influence,
    the firm yet gentle hand with which it brings heterogeneous populations under the
    control of a common faith and discipline, the ease with which it adapts itself to new
    conditions and organizes itself in every part of the country. It is not a little
    thing, in spite of unfriendly public opinion and of great and numerous obstacles, in
    spite of the burden which high achievements impose and of the lack of easy and supple
    movement which gathering years imply, to enter new fields, to bend one's self to
    unaccustomed work, and to struggle for the right to live in the midst of a generation
    heedless of the good, and mindful only of the evil which has been associated with
    one's life. This is what the Catholic Church in America has had to do, and has done
    with a success which recalls the memory of the spread of Christianity through the
    Roman Em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
    178]</a></span>pire. It counts its members here by millions, while a hundred years
    ago it counted them by thousands; and its priests, churches, schools, and
    institutions of charity it reckons by the thousand, while then they could be counted
    hardly by tens. Public opinion which was then hostile is no longer so in the same
    degree. Prejudice has not indeed ceased to exist; for where there is question of
    religion, of society, of politics, even the fairest minds fail to see things as they
    are, and the multitude, it may be supposed, will never become impartial; but the
    tendency of our life and of the age is opposed to bigotry, and as we lose faith in
    the justice and efficacy of persecution, we perceive more clearly that true religion
    can neither be defended nor propagated by violence and intolerance, by appeals to
    sectarian bitterness and national hatred. By none is this more sincerely
    acknowledged, or more deeply felt, than by the Catholics of the United States.</p>
    <p>The special significance of our American Catholic history is not found in the
    phases of our life which attract attention, and are a common theme for declamation;
    but it lies in the fact that our example proves that the Church can thrive where it
    is neither protected nor persecuted, but is simply left to itself to manage its own
    affairs and to do its work. Such an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179"
    id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>periment had never been made when we became an
    independent people, and its success is of world-wide import, because this is the
    modern tendency and the position toward the Church which all the nations will sooner
    or later assume; just as they all will be forced finally to accept popular rule. The
    great underlying principle of democracy,&mdash;that men are brothers and have equal
    rights, and that God clothes the soul with freedom,&mdash;is a truth taught by
    Christ, is a truth proclaimed by the Church; and the faith of Christians in this
    principle, in spite of hesitations and misgivings, of oppositions and obstacles and
    inconceivable difficulties, has finally given to it its modern vigor and beneficent
    power. The spirit of love and mercy, which is the spirit of Christ, breathes like a
    heavenly zephyr through the whole earth, and under its influence the age is moved to
    attempt greater things than hitherto have seemed possible. Never before has sympathy
    among men been so widespread; never has the desire to come to the relief of all who
    suffer pain or wrong been so general or so intelligent. To feed the hungry, to clothe
    the naked, to visit the sick, seems now comparatively a little thing. Our purpose is
    to create a social condition in which none shall lack food or clothing or shelter;
    following the divine command: "O Israel, thou shalt not suffer that<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> there be a
    beggar or a pauper within thy borders." Kindness to slaves ceased to be a virtue for
    us when we abolished slavery; and we look forward to the day when nor man nor woman
    nor child shall work and still be condemned to a life of misery. That great blot upon
    the page of history, woman's fate, has partly been erased, and we are drawing near to
    the time when in the world as in Christ there shall be made no distinction between
    slave and freeman, between man and woman. If we compare modern with ancient and
    medieval epochs, wars have become less frequent, and in war men have become more
    humane and merciful.</p>
    <p>Increasing knowledge of human life as it is found in the savage, in the barbarian,
    and in the civilized man, fixes us more unalterably in our belief in the worth of
    progress. The savage and the barbarian are hopelessly ignorant, and therefore weak
    and wretched, since ignorance is the chief source of man's misery. "My people," says
    the prophet, "are destroyed for lack of knowledge." From ignorance rather than from
    depravity have sprung the most appalling crimes, the most pernicious vices. In
    darkness of mind men have worshiped senseless material things, have deified every
    cruel and carnal passion; at the dictate of unenlightened conscience they have
    oppressed, laid waste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg
    181]</a></span> and murdered; for lack of knowledge they have perished in the snows
    of winter, been wasted by miasmatic air, have fallen victims to famine and
    pestilence, and have bowed for centuries beneath the degrading yoke of tyranny.
    Science is a ministering angel. The Jesuits by bringing quinine to the knowledge of
    civilized man have done more to relieve suffering than all the builders of hospitals.
    Vaccine has wrought more potently than the all-forgetful love of mothers; more than
    all the patriots gunpowder has won victories over tyrants; and the printing-press is
    a greater teacher than philosophers, writers, poets, schools, and universities. Like
    a heavenly messenger the compass guides man whithersoever he will go, still turning
    to the one fixed point, as turn the hearts of the children of men to God. The nations
    intermingle and lose their jealousies and hatreds, borne everywhere by the power of
    steam; and the thoughts of men are carried by lightning round the whole earth.
    Commerce has become a world-wide interchange of good offices; and while it adds to
    the comfort of all, it enlarges thought and strengthens sympathy. Our greater
    knowledge has enabled us to lengthen human life; to extinguish some of the most
    virulent diseases; to perform surgical operations without pain; to increase the
    fertility of the soil; to make pestilential regions habita<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>ble; to illumine our cities and
    homes at night with the brilliancy of day; to give to laborers better clothing and
    dwellings than princes in other ages have had. It has opened to our vision the
    limitless sidereal expanse, and revealed to us a heavenly glory which transcends the
    imagination of inspired poets. Before this new light the earth has dwindled away and
    become an atom, as the stars hide when the great sun wheels upward from out the
    night. We have looked into the very heart of the sun itself, and know of what it is
    made; and with the microscope we have caught sight of the marvelous world of the
    infinitesimally small, have seen what human eye had never beheld, and have watched
    unseen life building up and breaking down all living organisms. We have learned how
    to walk secure in the depths of ocean, to soar in mid-air, to rush on our way
    unimpeded through the stony hearts of mountains. We see the earth grow from a
    fire-ball to be the home of man; we know its anatomy; we read its history; and we
    behold races of animals which passed away ages before the eye of man looked forth
    upon the boundless mystery and saw the shadow of the presence of the infinite God.
    Better than the Greeks we know the history of Greece; than the Romans that of Rome.
    Words that were never written have whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183"
    id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> to us the dreams and hopes of people that perished
    and left no record; and the more we have learned of the past the more clearly do we
    perceive how far the present age surpasses all others in knowledge and in power.</p>
    <p>The mighty movement by which this development has been caused, has not slackened,
    but seems each day to gain new force; and the marvelous changes, political, social,
    moral, intellectual, and physical, which give character to the nineteenth century are
    but the prelude to a drama which shall make all past achievements of our race appear
    weak and contemptible. To imagine that our superiority is merely mechanical and
    material is to fail to see things as they are. Greater individuals may have lived
    than now are living, but never before has the world been governed with so much wisdom
    and so much justice; and the power back of our progress is intellectual, moral, and
    religious. Science is not material. It is the product of intellect and will; and the
    great founders of modern science, Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon, Descartes, Galileo,
    Newton, Leibnitz, Amp&egrave;re, Liebig, Fresnel, Faraday, and Mayer, were
    Christians. "However paradoxical it may sound," says DuBois-Reymond, "modern science
    owes its origin to Christianity."</p>
    <p>Since the course of events is left chiefly to<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> the direction of natural causes,
    and since science enables man to bend the stars, the lightning, the winds, and the
    waves to his purposes, what shall resist the onward march of those who are armed with
    such power? Since life is a warfare, a struggle, how shall the ignorant and the
    thoughtless survive in a conflict in which natural knowledge has placed in the hands
    of the wise forces which the angels may not wield? Since the prosperity of the Church
    is left subject to human influence, shall the Son of Man find faith on earth when he
    comes if the most potent instrument God has given to man is abandoned to those who
    know not Christ? Why should we who reckon it a part of the glory of the Church in the
    past that she labored to civilize barbarians, to emancipate slaves, to elevate woman,
    to preserve the classical writings, to foster music, painting, sculpture,
    architecture, poetry, and eloquence, think it no part of her mission now to encourage
    scientific research? To be Catholic is to be drawn not only to the love of whatever
    is good and beautiful, but also to the love of whatever is true; and to do the best
    work the Catholic Church must fit herself to a constantly changing environment, to
    the character of every people, and to the wants of each age. Has not Christ declared
    that whoever is not against us is for us; and may we<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> not therefore find friends in all
    who work for worthy ends,&mdash;for liberty and knowledge, for increase of power and
    love? This large sympathy, which true religion and the best culture promote, is
    Catholic, and it is also American; for here with us, I think, the whole world is for
    men of good-will who are not fools. We who are the children of ancient Faith, who
    inherit the boon from fathers who held it to be above all price, are saved, where
    there is question of former times, from irreverent thoughts and shallow views.</p>

    <p>But if like the old, the Church can look to the past, like the young, she can look
    to the future. If there are Catholics who linger regretful amid glories that have
    vanished, there are also Catholics who in the midst of their work feel a confidence
    which leaves no place for regret; who well understand that the earthly environment in
    which the Church lives is subject to change and decay, and that new surroundings
    imply new tasks and impose new duties. The splendor of the medieval Church,<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> its worldly
    power, the pomp of its ceremonial, the glittering pageantry in which its pontiffs and
    prelates vied with kings and emperors in gorgeous display, are gone, or going; and
    were it given to man to recall the past, the spirit whereby it lived would still be
    wanting. But it is the mark of youthful and barbarous natures to have eyes chiefly
    for the garb and circumstance of religion, to see the body only and not the soul. At
    all events the course of life is onward, and enthusiasm for the past cannot become
    the source of great and far reaching action. The present alone gives opportunity; and
    the face of hope turns to the future, and the wise are busy with what lies at hand,
    with immediate duty, and not with schemes for bringing back the things that have
    passed away. Leaving their dead with the dead, they work for life and for the
    living.</p>
    <p>As in each individual there is a better and a worse self, so in each age there are
    conflicting tendencies; but it is the part of enlightened minds and generous hearts
    to see what is true, and to love what is good. The fault-finder is hateful both in
    life and in literature; and it is Iago, the most despicable of characters, whom
    Shakespeare makes say, "I am nothing if not critical." A Christian of all men is
    without excuse for being fretful and sour, for thinking<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> and acting as though this were a
    devil's world, and not the eternal God's, as though there were danger lest the
    Almighty should not prevail. We know that God is, and therefore that all will be
    well; and if it were conceivable that God is not, it would still be the part of a
    true man to labor to make knowledge and virtue prevail. The criticism of the age
    which gives a better understanding of its needs is good; all other is baneful.</p>
    <p>Opinion rules the world, and a right appreciation of the influences by which
    opinion is molded is the surest guide to a knowledge of the time. In ignorant and
    barbarous ages the notions and beliefs of men are crude, and are controlled by a few,
    for only a few possess knowledge and influence; and even in the age of Pericles and
    Augustus, the thought of mankind means the thoughts of some dozens of men. A few
    vigorous minds founded schools of opinion and style, became intellectual dictators,
    and asserted their authority for centuries. As the art of printing was yet unknown,
    and books were rare, the teacher was the speaker; orators held sway over the destiny
    of nations; and the Christian pulpit became the world's university. But the
    printing-press in giving to thought a permanent form which is placed under the eyes
    of the whole world has made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188"
    id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> passion, the splendor, the majestic phrase of
    oratory seem unreal as an actor's speech, evanescent as a singer's tones; and hence
    the pulpit and the rostrum, though they still have influence, can never again
    exercise the control over opinion which belonged to them when all men had not become
    readers.</p>
    <p>What is true of eloquence may be affirmed of all art. In spite of ourselves, even
    the best of us find it difficult to make art a serious business; and unless taken
    seriously, it is vain, loses its soul, and falls into the hands of pretenders and
    sentimentalists. Once painting, sculpture, architecture, and song were the expression
    of thoughts and moods which irresistibly appealed for utterance; but with us they are
    a fashion, like cosmetics and laces. Poetry, the highest of arts, has lost its
    original character of song, and the poet now deals, in an imaginative way, with
    problems which puzzle metaphysicians and theologians. The causes that have robbed art
    of so much of its charm and power have necessarily diminished the influence of
    ceremonial worship, which is the artistic expression of the soul's faith and love, of
    its hopes and yearnings. We are, indeed, still subdued by the majesty of dimly
    lighted cathedrals, by solemn music, and the various symbolism of the ritual, but we
    feel not the deep awe of our fathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189"
    id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> whose knees furrowed the pavement stones, and whose
    burning lips kissed them smooth; and to blame ourselves for this would serve no
    purpose. To those who find no pleasure in sweet sounds, we pipe in vain, and argument
    to show that one ought to be moved by what leaves him cold, is meaningless. Emotion
    is spontaneous, and adorers, like lovers, neither ask nor care for reasons. There is
    in fact an element of illusion in feeling; passion is non-rational; and when the
    spirit of the time is intellectual, men are seldom devout, however religious they may
    be. The scientific habit of mind is not favorable to childlike and unreasoning faith;
    and the new views of the physical universe which the modern mind is forced to take,
    bring us face to face with new problems in religion and morals, in politics and
    society.</p>
    <p>Whatever we may think of the past, whatever we may fear or hope for the future, if
    we would make an impression on the world around us, we must understand the thoughts,
    the purposes, and the methods of those with whom we live; and we must at the same
    time recognize that though the truth of religion be unchangeable, the mind of man is
    not so, and that the point of view varies not only from people to people, and from
    age to age, but from year to year in the growing thought of<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> the individual and of the world. As
    in travelling round the earth, time changes, and when it is morning here, it is
    evening there, so with difference of latitude and longitude, of civilization and
    barbarism, the opinions and manners of men grow different. They who observe from
    positions widely separate do not see the same things, or do not see them in the same
    light. Proof for a peasant is not proof for a philosopher; and arguments which in one
    age are held to be unanswerable, in another lose power to convince, or become
    altogether meaningless. It is not to be imagined that the hearts of Christians should
    again burn with the devotional enthusiasm and the warlike ardor of the Crusaders; and
    just as little is it conceivable that men should again become passionately interested
    in the questions which in the fourth and fifth centuries filled the world with the
    noise of theological disputation. It were mere loss of time to beat now the waste
    fields of the Protestant controversy. Wiseman's book on science and revealed
    religion, which fifty years ago attracted attention, lies like a stranded ship on a
    deserted shore, and attempts of the kind are held in slight esteem. The immature mind
    is eager to reduce faith to knowledge; but the accomplished thinker understands that
    knowledge begins and ends in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191"
    id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> faith. There is oppugnancy between belief in an
    all-wise, all-good, and all-powerful God, and belief in the divine origin of Nature,
    whose face is smeared with filth and blood; but we hold that the conflicting faiths
    and increasing knowledge cannot add to the difficulty. On the contrary, the higher
    the intelligence, the purer Nature seems to grow. The chemical elements are as fair
    and sweet in the corpse as in the living body, and the earthquake and the cyclone
    obey the same laws which make the waters flow and the zephyrs breathe perfume. It is
    the imagination and not the reason that is overwhelmed by the idea of unending space
    and time. To the intellect, eternity is not more mysterious than the present moment,
    and the distance which separates us from the remotest stars is not more
    incomprehensible than a hand's breadth. Science is the widening thought of man,
    working on the hypothesis of universal intelligibility toward universal intelligence;
    and religion is the soul, escaping from the labyrinth of matter to the light and love
    of the Infinite; and on the heights they meet and are at peace.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile they who seek natural knowledge must admit that faith, hope, and love
    are the everlasting foundations of human life, and that a philosophic creed is as
    sterile as Platonic love; and they who uphold religion must confess that<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> faith which
    ignorance alone can keep alive is little better than superstition. To strive to
    attain truth under whatever form is to seek to know God; and yet no ideal can be true
    for man, unless it can be made to minister to faith, hope, and love; for by them we
    live. Let us then teach ourselves to see things as they are, without preoccupation or
    misgivings lest what is should ever make it impossible, for us to believe and hope in
    the better yet to be. Science and morality need religion as much as thought and
    action require emotion; and beyond the utmost reach of the human mind lie the
    boundless worlds of mystery where the soul must believe and adore what it can but
    dimly discern. The Copernican theory of the heavens startled believers at first; but
    we have long since grown accustomed to the new view which reveals to us a universe
    infinitely more glorious than aught the ancients ever imagined. We do not rightly see
    either the things which are always around us, or those which for the first time are
    presented to our eyes; and when novel theories of the visible world, which in some
    sense is part of our very being, profoundly alter our traditional notions, the mind
    is disturbed and overclouded, and the lapse of time alone can make plain the real
    bearing of the new learning upon life, upon religion, and upon society. There<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> can be no doubt
    but increase of knowledge involves incidental evils, just as the progress of
    civilization multiplies our wants; but the wise are not therefore driven to seek help
    from ignorance and barbarism. Whatever the loss, all knowledge is gain. The evils
    that spring from enlightenment of mind will find their remedy in greater
    enlightenment. Such at least is the faith of an age whose striking characteristic is
    confidence in education. Men have ceased to care for the bliss there may be in
    ignorance, and those who dread knowledge, if such there still be, are as far away
    from the life of this century as the dead whose bones crumbled to dust a thousand
    years ago.</p>
    <p>The aim the best now propose to themselves is to provide not wealth or pleasure,
    or better machinery or more leisure, but a higher and more effective kind of
    education; and hence whatever one's preoccupation, whether social, political,
    religious, or industrial, the question of education forces itself upon his attention.
    Pedagogy has grown to be a science, and chairs are founded in universities to expound
    the theory and art of teaching. The learning of former times has become the ignorance
    of our own; and the classical writings have ceased to be the treasure-house of
    knowledge, and in consequence their educational value has diminished.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
    <p>Whoever three hundred years ago wished to acquaint himself with philosophic,
    poetic, or eloquent expression of the best that was known, was compelled to seek for
    it in the Greek and Latin authors; but now Greek and Latin are accomplishments
    chiefly, and a classical scholar, if unacquainted with modern science and literature,
    is hopelessly ignorant. "If any one," said Hegius, the teacher of Erasmus, "wishes to
    learn grammar, rhetoric, mathematics, history, or holy scripture, let him read
    Greek;" and in his day this was as true as it is false and absurd in our own. In the
    Middle Ages, Latin was made the groundwork of the educational system, not on account
    of any special value it may have been supposed to possess as a mental discipline, but
    because it was the language of the learned, of all who spoke or wrote on questions of
    religion, philosophy, literature, and science; but now, who that is able to think
    dreams of burying his thought in a Greek or Roman urn? The Germans in philosophy, the
    English in poetry, have surpassed the Greeks; and French prose is not inferior in
    qualities of style to the ancient classics, and in wealth of thought and knowledge so
    far excels them as to preclude comparison.</p>
    <p>The life of Greece and Rome, compared with ours, was narrow and superficial; their
    ideas of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
    Nature were crude and often grotesque; they lacked sympathy; the Greek had no sense
    of sin; the Roman none of the mercy which tempers justice. In their eyes the child
    was not holy, woman was not sacred, the slave was not man. Their notion of liberty
    was political and patriotic merely; the human soul, standing forth alone, and
    appealing from States and emperors to the living God, was to them a scandal. Now
    literature is the outgrowth of a people's life and thought, and the nobler the life,
    the more enlightened the thought, the more valuable will the expression be; and since
    there is greater knowledge, wisdom, freedom, justice, mercy, goodness, power, in
    Christendom now than ever existed in the pagan world, it would certainly be an
    anomaly if modern literature were inferior to the classical. The ancients, indeed,
    excel us in the sense for form and symmetry. There is also a freshness in their
    words, a joyousness in their life, a certain heroic temper in their thinking and
    acting, which give them power to engage the emotions; and hence to deny them
    exceptional educational value is to take a partial view. But even though we grant
    that the study of their literatures is in certain respects the best intellectual
    discipline, education, it must be admitted, means knowledge as well as training; and
    thorough training is something more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196"
    id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> refined taste. It is strength as well, and ability
    to think in many directions and on many subjects. Nothing known to men should escape
    the attention of the wise; for the knowledge of the age determines what is demanded
    of the scholar. And since it is our privilege to live at a time when knowledge is
    increasing more rapidly even than population and wealth, we must, if we hope to stand
    in the front ranks of those who know, keep pace with the onward movement of mind. To
    turn away from this outburst of splendor and power; to look back to pagan
    civilization or Christian barbarism,&mdash;is to love darkness more than light.
    Aristotle is a great mind, but his learning is crude and his ideas of Nature are
    frequently grotesque. Saint Thomas is a powerful intellect; but his point of view in
    all that concerns natural knowledge has long since vanished from sight. What poverty
    of learning does not the early medieval scheme of education reveal; and when in the
    twelfth century the idea of a university rises in the best minds, how incomplete and
    vague it is! Amid the ruins of castles and cathedrals we grow humble, and think
    ourselves inferior to men who thus could build. But they were not as strong as we,
    and they led a more ignorant and a blinder life; and so when we read of great names
    of the past, the mists of illusion fill the skies, and our eyes are<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> dimmed by the
    glory of clouds tinged with the splendors of a sun that has set.</p>
    <p>Certainly a true university will be the home both of ancient wisdom and of new
    learning; it will teach the best that is known, and encourage research; it will
    stimulate thought, refine taste, and awaken the love of excellence; it will be at
    once a scientific institute, a school of culture, and a training ground for the
    business of life; it will educate the minds that give direction to the age; it will
    be a nursery of ideas, a centre of influence. The good we do men is quickly lost, the
    truth we leave them remains forever; and therefore the aim of the best education is
    to enable students to see what is true, and to inspire them with the love of all
    truth. Professional knowledge brings most profit to the individual; but philosophy
    and literature, science and art, elevate and refine the spirit of the whole people,
    and hence the university will make culture its first aim, and its scope will widen as
    the thoughts and attainments of men are enlarged and multiplied. Here if anywhere
    shall be found teachers whose one passion is the love of truth, which is the love of
    God and of man; who look on all things with a serene eye; who bring to every question
    a calm, unbiased mind; who, where the light of the intellect fails, walk by faith and
    accept the omen of hope;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg
    198]</a></span> who understand that to be distrustful of science is to lack culture,
    to doubt the good of progress is to lack knowledge, and to question the necessity of
    religion is to want wisdom; who know that in a God-made and God-governed world it
    must lie in the nature of things that reason and virtue should tend to prevail, in
    spite of the fact that in every age the majority of men think foolishly and act
    unwisely. How divine is not man's apprehensive endowment! When we see beauty fade,
    the singer lose her charm, the performer his skill, we feel no commiseration; but
    when we behold a noble mind falling to decay, we are saddened, for we cannot believe
    that the godlike and immortal faculty should be subject to death's power. It is a
    reflection of the light that never yet was seen on sea or land; it is the magician
    who shapes and colors the universe, as a drop of water mirrors the boundless sky. Is
    not this the first word the Eternal speaks?&mdash;"Let there be light." And does not
    the blessed Saviour come talking of life, of light, of truth, of joy, and peace? Have
    not the Christian nations moved forward following after liberty and knowledge? Is not
    our religion the worship of God in spirit and in truth? Is not its motive Love,
    divine and human, and is not knowledge Love's guide and minister?</p>
    <p>The future prevails over the present, the un<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>seen over what touches the senses
    only in high and cultivated natures; and it is held to be the supreme triumph of God
    over souls when the young, to whom the earth seems to be heaven revealed and made
    palpable, turn from all the beauty and contagious joy to seek, to serve, to love Him
    who is the infinite and only real good. Yet this is what we ask of the lovers of
    intellectual excellence, who work without hope of temporal reward and without the
    strength of heart which is found in obeying the Divine Will; for mental improvement
    is seldom urged as a religious duty, although it is plain that to seek to know truth
    is to seek to know God, in whom and through whom and by whom all things are, and
    whose infinite nature and most awful power may best be seen by the largest and most
    enlightened mind. Mind is Heaven's pioneer making way for faith, hope, and love, for
    higher aims and nobler life; and to doubt its worth and excellence is to deny the
    reasonableness of religion, since belief, if not wholly blind, must rest on
    knowledge. The best culture serves spiritual and moral ends. Its aim and purpose is
    to make reason prevail over sense and appetite; to raise man not only to a perception
    of the harmonies of truth, but also to the love of whatever is good and fair. Not in
    a darkened mind does the white ray of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200"
    id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> heavenly light break into prismatic glory; not
    through the mists of ignorance is the sweet countenance of the divine Saviour best
    discerned. If some have pursued a sublime art frivolously; have soiled a fair mind by
    ignoble life,&mdash;this leaves the good of the intellect untouched. Some who have
    made strongest profession of religion, who have held high and the highest places in
    the Church, have been unworthy, but we do not thence infer that the tendency of
    religion is to make men so. They who praise the bliss and worth of ignorance are
    sophists. Stupidity is more to be dreaded than malignity; for ignorance, and not
    malice, is the most fruitful cause of human misery. Let knowledge grow, let truth
    prevail. Since God is God, the universe is good, and the more we know of its laws,
    the plainer will the right way become. The investigator and the thinker, the man of
    culture and the man of genius, cannot free themselves from bias and limitation; but
    the work they do will help me and all men.</p>
    <p>Indifference or opposition to the intellectual life is but a survival of the
    general anti-educational prejudices of former ages. It is also a kind of envy,
    prompting us to find fault with whatever excellence is a reproach to our
    unworthiness. The disinterested love of truth is<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> a rare virtue, most difficult to
    acquire and most difficult to preserve. If knowledge bring power and wealth, if it
    give fame and pleasure, it is dear to us; but how many are able to love it for its
    own sake? Do not nearly all men strive to convince themselves of the truth of those
    opinions which they are interested in holding? What is true, good, or fair is rarely
    at once admitted to be so; but what is practically useful men quickly accept, because
    they live chiefly in the world of external things, and care little for the spiritual
    realms of truth and beauty. The ignorant do not even believe that knowledge gives
    power and pleasure, and the educated, except the chosen few, value it only for the
    power and pleasure it gives. As the disinterested love of truth is rare, so is
    perfect sincerity. Indeed, insincerity is here the radical vice. Good faith is
    essential to faith; and a sophistical mind is as immoral and irreligious as a
    depraved heart. Let a man be true, seek and speak truth, and all good things are
    possible; but when he persuades himself that a lie may be useful and ought to be
    propagated, he becomes the enemy of his own soul and the foe of all that makes life
    high and godlike.</p>
    <p>Now, to be able to desire to see things as they are, whatever their relations to
    ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
    may be, and to speak of them simply as they appear to us, is one result of the best
    training of the intellect, which in the world of thought and opinion gives us that
    sweet indifference which is the rule of saints when they submit the conduct of their
    lives wholly to divine guidance. Why should he whose mind is strong, and rests on
    God, be disturbed? It is with opinion as with life. We cannot tell what moment truth
    will overthrow the one and death the other; but thought cannot change the nature of
    things. The clouds dissolve, but the eternal heavens remain. Over the bloodiest
    battlefields they bend calm and serene, and trees drink the sunlight and flowers
    exhale perfume. The moonbeam kisses the crater's lip. Over buried cities the yellow
    harvest waves, and all the catastrophes of endless time are present to God, who
    dwells in infinite peace. He sees the universe and is not troubled, and shall not we
    who are akin to him learn to look upon our little meteorite without losing repose of
    mind and heart? Were it not a sweeter piety to trust that he who made all things will
    know how to make all things right; and therefore not to grow anxious lest some
    investigator should find him at fault or thwart his plans? As living bodies are
    immersed in an invisible substance which feeds the flame<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> of life, so souls breathe and think
    and love in the atmosphere of God, and the higher their thought and love the more do
    they partake of the divine nature. Many things, in this age of transition, are
    passing away; but true thoughts and pure love are immortal, and whatever opinions as
    to other things a man may hold, all know that to be human is to be intelligent and
    moral, and therefore religious. A hundred years hence our present machinery may seem
    to be as rude as the implements of the middle age look to us, and our political and
    social organization may appear barbarous,&mdash;so rapid has the movement of life
    become. But we do not envy those who shall then be living, partly it may be because
    we can have but dim visions of the greater blessings they shall enjoy, but chiefly
    because we feel that after all the true worth of life lies in nothing of this kind,
    but in knowing and doing, in believing and loving; and that it would not be easier to
    live for truth and righteousness were electricity applied to aerial navigation and
    all the heavens filled with argosies of magic sail. It is not possible to love
    sincerely the best thoughts, as it is not possible to love God when our aim is
    something external, or when we believe that what is mechanical merely has power to
    regenerate and exalt mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204"

    <p>He who believes in culture must believe in God; for what but God do we mean when
    we talk of loving the best thoughts and the highest beauty? No God, no best; but at
    most better and worse. And how shall a man's delight in his growing knowledge not be
    blighted by a hidden taint, if he is persuaded that at the core of the universe there
    is only blind unconscious force? But if he believe that God is infinite power working
    for truth and love, then can he also feel that in seeking to prepare his mind for the
    perception of truth and his heart for the love of what is good and fair, he is
    working with God, and moves along the way in which his omnipotent hand guides
    heavenly spirits and all the countless worlds. He desires that all men should be
    wiser and stronger and more loving, even though he should be doomed to remain as he
    is, for then they would have power to help him. He is certain of himself, and feels
    no fear nor anger when his opinions are opposed. He learns to bear what he cannot
    prevent, knowing that courage and patience make tolerable im<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>medicable ills. He feels no
    self-complacency, but rather the self-dissatisfaction which comes of the
    consciousness of possessing faculties which he can but imperfectly use. And this
    discontent he believes to be the infinite God stirring within the soul. As the
    earthquake which swallows some island in another hemisphere disturbs not the even
    tenor of our way, so the passions of men whose world is other than his, who dwell
    remote from what he contemplates and loves, shake not his tranquil mind. While they
    threaten and pursue, his thought moves in spheres unknown to them. He knows how
    little life at the best can give, and is not hard to console for the loss of
    anything. There is no true thought which he would not gladly make his own, even
    though it should be the watchword of his enemies. Since morality is practical truth,
    he understands that increasing knowledge will make it at once more evident and more
    attractive. Hatred between races and nations he holds to be not less unchristian than
    the hatred which arms the individual against his fellow-man. It is impossible for him
    to be a scoffer; for whatever has strengthened or consoled a human soul is sacred in
    his eyes; and wherever there is question of what is socially complex, as of a
    religion or a civilization, there is question of many human<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> lives, their hopes, their joys,
    their strivings, their yearnings, disappointments, agonies, and deaths; and he is
    able to perceive that in the ports of levity there is no refuge for hearts that
    mourn. Does not love itself, in its heaven of bliss, turn away from him who mocks?
    The lover of the intellectual life knows neither contempt nor indignation, is not
    elated by success or cast down by failure; money cannot make him rich, and poverty
    helps to make him free. His own experience teaches him that men in becoming wiser
    will become nobler and happier; and this sweet truth has in his eyes almost the
    elements of a religion. With growing knowledge his power of sympathy is enlarged;
    until like Saint Francis, he can call the sun his brother and the moon his sister;
    can grieve with homeless winds, and feel a kinship with the clod. The very agonies by
    which his soul has been wrung open to his gaze visions of truth which else he had
    never caught, and so he finds even in things evil some touch of goodness. Praise and
    blame are for children, but to him impertinent. He is tolerant of absurdity because
    it is so all-pervading that he whom it fills with indignation can have no repose.
    While he labors like other men to keep his place in the world, he strives to make the
    work whereby he maintains himself, and those who cling to him, serve intellectual and
    moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> ends.
    He has a meek and lowly heart, and he has also a free and illumined mind, and a soul
    without fear. He knows that no gift or accomplishment is incompatible with true
    religion; for has not the Church intellects as many-sided and as high as Augustine
    and Chrysostom, Dante and Calderon, Descartes and Da Vinci, De Vega and Cervantes,
    Bossuet and Pascal, Saint Bernard and Gregory the Seventh, Aquinas and Michael
    Angelo, Mozart and F&eacute;nelon? Ah! I behold the youthful throng, happier than we,
    who here, in their own sweet country,&mdash;in this city of government and of law
    with its wide streets, its open spaces, its air of freedom and of
    light,&mdash;undisturbed by the soul-depressing hum of commerce and the
    unintellectual din of machinery, shall hearken to the voice of wisdom and walk in the
    pleasant ways of knowledge, alive, in every sense, to catch whatever message may come
    to them from God's universe; who, as they are drawn to what is higher than
    themselves, shall be drawn together, like planets to a sun; whose minds, aglow with
    high thinking, shall taste joy and delight fresher and purer than merriest laughter
    ever tells. Who has not seen, when leaden clouds fill the sky and throw gloomy
    shadows on the earth, some little meadow amid the hills, with its trees and flowers,
    its grazing kine and running brook, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208"
    id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> bathed in sunlight, and smiling as though a mother
    said, Come hither, darling?</p>
    <p>Such to my fancy is this favored spot, whose invitation is to the fortunate few
    who believe that "the noblest mind the best contentment has," and that the fairest
    land is that which brings forth and nurtures the fairest souls. When youthful friends
    drift apart, and meet again after years, they find they have been living not only in
    different cities, but in different worlds. Those who shall come up to the university
    must turn away from much the world holds dear; and while the companions they leave
    behind shall linger in pleasant places or shall get money, position, and applause,
    they must move on amid ever-increasing loneliness of life and thought. Xanthippe
    would have had altogether a better opinion of Socrates had he not been a philosopher,
    and the best we do is often that for which our age and our friends care the least;
    but they who have once tasted the delights of a cultivated mind would not exchange
    them for the gifts of fortune, and to have beheld the fair face of wisdom is to be
    forever her votary. Words spoken for the masses grow obsolete; but what is fit to be
    heard by the chosen few shall be true and beautiful while such minds are found on
    earth. In the end, it is this little band&mdash;this intellectual aristoc<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>racy&mdash;who
    move and guide the world. They see what is possible, outline projects, and give
    impulse, while the people do the work. That which is strongest in man is mind; and
    when a mind truly vigorous, open, supple, and illumined reveals itself, we follow in
    its path of light. How it may be I do not know; but the very brain and heart of
    genius throbs forever in the words on which its spirit has breathed. Let this seed,
    though hidden like the grain in mummy pits for thousands of years, but fall on proper
    soil, and soon the golden harvest shall wave beneath the dome of azure skies; let but
    some generous youth bend over the electric page, and lo! all his being shall thrill
    and flame with new-born life and light. Genius is a gift. But whoever keeps on doing
    in all earnestness something which he need not do, and for which the world cares
    hardly at all, if he have not genius, has at least one of its chief marks; and it is,
    I think, an important function of a university to create an intellectual atmosphere
    in which the love of excellence shall become contagious, which whosoever breathes
    shall, like the Sibyl, feel the inspiration of divine thoughts.</p>

      <p>The bishop writes out of the fullness of his heart, and with abundant love and
      charity. His works make the world wiser, happier, and better. These "Thoughts and

    <blockquote>
      <p>Bishop Spalding has struck a note which must vibrate in every heart which loves
      the glory of Christianity and the progress of humanity.... The book is a stimulant,

      <p>Out of a disciplined and fertile mind he pours forth epigrammatic sentences and

      <p>Bishop Spalding comes nearer being an essayist in education than any other
      American. He has that rarest of educational gifts,&mdash;the ability to throw light
      brilliantly, and yet softly, making his paragraphs both bright and mellow, all
      without "preaching," without pedantry, and without being cranky.&mdash;<i>Journal

      <p>In this volume, as in his other books, Bishop Spalding is occupied with the
      larger problems of education. In addition to the specifically educational subjects
      there are themes of the widest possible interest, to the treatment of which the
      ripe experience of the writer gives high value.</p>

    <h3>A GENERAL SURVEY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE</h3>
    <h4>By MARY FISHER</h4>
    <center>
      Gilt top, deckle edges, 12mo. $1.50
    </center>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this volume Miss Fisher has treated a subject of vital interest and
      importance for all American lovers of literature, and she has accomplished her task
      with rare feminine appreciation and sympathy, with a clear and decisive interest,
      with a catholicity of judgment and a fine sense of discrimination and proportion
      and with a warmth and delicacy of treatment that transform these biographical
      sketches into little gems of portraiture.&mdash;<i>The Commercial Advertiser</i>,
      New York.</p>
      <p>The great value of the book lies in the fact that while Miss Fisher has a
      thorough familiarity with the subjects of her essays, she writes as she might if
      she were ignorant of the estimation in which they are held by the public or by the
      critics. She applies discriminating reason and sound principles of judgment to the
      work of the various writers, without the slightest reference to their personal
      dignity or their literary fame.&mdash;<i>The Book Buyer</i>, New York.</p>
      <p>The whole range of notable writers are dealt with in a style at once
      discriminating and attractive. The "human touch" is pleasingly apparent throughout
      the book.&mdash;<i>The Living Age</i>, Boston.</p>

      <p>Of this book, on the best in English Literature, which has already been declared
      of the highest value by the testimony of the best critics in this country, an
      edition of one thousand copies has just been ordered for London, the home of
      English Literature,&mdash;a compliment of which its scholarly western author may

      <p>It is decidedly the best and most complete Life of Lincoln that has yet
      appeared.&mdash;<i>Contemporary Review, London</i>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Arnold succeeded to a singular extent in assuming the broad view and
      judicious voice of posterity and exhibiting the greatest figure of our time in its
      true perspective.&mdash;<i>The Tribune, New York</i>.</p>
      <p>It is the only Life of Lincoln thus far published that is likely to
      live,&mdash;the only one that has any serious pretensions to depict him with
      adequate veracity, completeness, and dignity.&mdash;<i>The Sun, New York</i>.</p>
      <p>The author knew Mr. Lincoln long and intimately, and no one was better fitted
      for the task of preparing his biography. He has written with tenderness and
      fidelity, with keen discrimination, and with graphic powers of description and
      analysis.&mdash;<i>The Interior, Chicago</i>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Arnold's "Life of President Lincoln" is excellent in almost every
      respect.... The author has painted a graphic and life-like portrait of the
      remarkable man who was called to decide on the destinies of his country at the
      crisis of its fate.&mdash;<i>The Times, London</i>.</p>
      <p>The book is particularly rich in incidents connected with the early career of
      Mr. Lincoln; and it is without exception the most satisfactory record of his life
      that has yet been written. Readers will also find that in its entirety it is a work
      of absorbing and enduring interest that will enchain the attention more effectually
      than any novel.&mdash;<i>Magazine of American History, New York</i>.</p>

      described by easy-going writers of book-notices as supplying a long-felt want, we
      know of none which so completely carries out the intention of the writer as 'The
      Standard Operas,' by Mr. George P. Upton, whose object is to present to his readers
      a comprehensive sketch of each of the operas contained in the modern repertory....
      There are thousands of music-loving people who will be glad to have the kind of
      knowledge which Mr. Upton has collected for their benefit, and has cast in a clear
      and compact form."&mdash;<i>R. H. Stoddard, in "Evening Mail and Express" (New
      York)</i>.</p>
      <p>"The summaries of the plots are so clear, logical, and well written, that one
      can read them with real pleasure, which cannot be said of the ordinary operatic
      synopses. But the most important circumstance is that Mr. Upton's book is fully
      abreast of the times."&mdash;<i>The Nation (New York</i>).</p>

      <p>Music lovers are under a new obligation to Mr. Upton for this companion to his
      "Standard Operas,"&mdash;two books which deserve to be placed on the same shelf
      with Grove's and Riemann's musical dictionaries.&mdash;<i>The Nation, New
      York</i>.</p>
      <p>Mr. George P. Upton has followed in the lines that he laid down in his "Standard
      Operas," and has produced an admirable handwork, which answers every purpose that
      such a volume is designed to answer, and which is certain to be popular now and for
      years to come.&mdash;<i>The Mail and Express, New York</i>.</p>
      <p>Like the valuable art handbooks of Mrs. Jamison, these volumes contain a world
      of interesting information, indispensable to critics and art amateurs. The volume
      under review is elegantly and succinctly written, and the subjects are handled in a
      thoroughly comprehensive manner.&mdash;<i>Public Opinion, Washington</i>.</p>
      <p>The book is a masterpiece of skillful handling, charming the reader with its
      pure English style, and keeping his attention always awake in an arrangement of
      matter which makes each succeeding page and chapter fresh in interest and always
      full of instruction, while always entertaining.&mdash;<i>The Standard,
      Chicago</i>.</p>
      <p>The author of this book has done a real service to the vast number of people
      who, while they are lovers of music, have neither the leisure nor inclination to
      become deeply versed in its literature.... The information conveyed is of just the
      sort that the average of cultivated people will welcome as an aid to comprehending
      and talking about this species of musical composition.&mdash;<i>Church Magazine,
      Philadelphia</i>.</p>

      <p>The "Standard Cantatas" forms the third volume in the uniform series which
      already includes the now well known "Standard Operas" and the "Standard Oratorios."
      This latest work deals with a class of musical compositions, midway between the
      opera and the oratorio, which is growing rapidly in favor both with composers and
      audiences.</p>
      <p>As in the two former works, the subject is treated, so far as possible, in an
      untechnical manner, so that it may satisfy the needs of musically uneducated music
      lovers, and add to their enjoyment by a plain statement of the story of the cantata
      and a popular analysis of its music, with brief pertinent selections from its
      poetical text.</p>
      <p>The book includes a comprehensive essay on the origin of the cantata, and its
      development from rude beginnings; biographical sketches of the composers; carefully
      prepared descriptions of the plots and the music; and an appendix containing the
      names and dates of composition of all the best known cantatas from the earliest
      times.</p>
      <p>This series of works on popular music has steadily grown in favor since the
      appearance of the first volume on the Operas. When the series is completed, as it
      will be next year by a volume on the Standard Symphonies, it will be, as the New
      York "Nation" has said, indispensable to every musical library.</p>

      <p>The usefulness of this handbook cannot be doubted. Its pages are packed full of
      these fascinating renderings. The accounts of each composer are succinct and yet
      sufficient. The author has done a genuine service to the world of music lovers. The
      comprehension of orchestral work of the highest character is aided efficiently by
      this volume. The mechanical execution of the volume is in harmony with its subject.
      No worthier volume can be found to put into the hands of an amateur or a friend of
      music.&mdash;<i>Public Opinion, Washington</i>.</p>
      <p>None who have seen the previous books of Mr. Upton will need assurance that this
      is as indispensable as the others to one who would listen intelligently to that
      better class of music which musicians congratulate themselves Americans are
      learning to appreciatively enjoy.&mdash;<i>Home Journal, New York</i>.</p>
      <p>There has never been, in this country at least, so thorough an attempt to
      collate the facts of programme music.... As a definite helper in some cases and as
      a refresher in others we believe Mr. Upton's book to have a lasting value.... The
      book, in brief, shows enthusiastic and honorable educational purpose, good taste,
      and sound scholarship.&mdash;<i>The American, Philadelphia</i>.</p>
      <p>Upton's books should be read and studied by all who desire to acquaint
      themselves with the facts and accomplishments in these interesting forms of musical
      composition.&mdash;<i>The Voice, New York</i>.</p>
      <p>It is written in a style that cannot fail to stimulate the reader, if also a
      student of music, to strive to find for himself the underlying meanings of the
      compositions of the great composers. It contains, besides, a vast amount of
      information about the symphony, its evolution and structure, with sketches of the
      composers, and a detailed technical description of a few symphonic models. It meets
      a recognized want of all concert goers.&mdash;<i>The Chautauquan</i>.</p>

    <h3>GROUND ARMS!</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This story is one of the strongest works of fiction of the present decade. The
      author is a philosopher and a philanthropist. Her clear, incisive reasoning, her
      large sympathies, combined with rare power of description, enable her to give the
      world a story which will hold in its thrall even the most shallow novel-reader who
      can appreciate good literature.&mdash;<i>The Arena</i>, Boston.</p>
      <p>The author pierces to the marrow of the thing that has taken hold of her. By
      that thing she is verily possessed; it has made of her a seer.... The bare, bald
      outline of "Die Waffen nieder!" ("Ground Arms!"), which is all we have been able to
      attempt, can give but a faint, feeble idea of its power and pathos, and none at all
      of the many light and humorous touches, the well-drawn minor characters, the
      thrilling episodes, the piquant glimpses of the great world of Austria and France,
      which relieve the gloom of the tragic story.&mdash;<i>International Journal of
      Ethics</i>.</p>
      <p>We have here unquestionably a very remarkable work. As a plea for a general
      disarmament it stands unrivaled. For a familiarity with the details of the subject
      treated, for breadth of view, for logical acumen, for dramatic effect and literary
      excellence, it stands unequaled by any work written with a
      purpose.&mdash;<i>Literary Digest</i>.</p>
      <p>With a powerful pen the author tells of the horrors of war; not alone the
      desolation of battlefields, but the scourges of typhus and cholera that follow in
      their wake, and the wretchedness, misery, and poverty brought to countless homes.
      The story in itself is simple but pathetic.... The book, which is sound and calm in
      its logic and reasoning, has made a grand impression upon military circles of
      Europe, and its influence is destined to extend far into the
      future.&mdash;<i>Public Opinion</i>, New York.</p>
